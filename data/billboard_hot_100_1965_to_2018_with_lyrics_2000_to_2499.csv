The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind, ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth, pain is all that you'll find
Should have known better, yeah


I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again, guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again the way I danced with you

Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind, ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth, pain is all that you'll find

I'm never gonna dance again, guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again the way I danced with you

Never without your love

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay, and...

I'm never gonna dance again, guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again the way I danced with you

Now that you're gone, now that you're gone
Now that you're gone, was what I did so wrong, so wrong
That you had to leave me alone?"

A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older

Now this mountain I must climb
Feels like a world upon my shoulders
Through the clouds I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder

In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me

I'm gonna take a little time
A little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me

In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is

Using the bodies up as we go
I'm waking up to fantasy
The shades all around aren't the colors we used to see
Broken ice still melts in the sun
And times that are broken can often be one again
We're soul alone
And soul really matters to me
Take a look around

You're out of touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around

Reaching out for something to hold
Looking for a love where the climate is cold
Manic moves and drowsy dreams
Or living in the middle between the two extremes
Smoking guns hot to the touch
Would cool down if we didn't
Use them so much, yeah
We're soul alone
And soul really matters to me
Too much

You're out of touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
(Out of touch, out of time)
You're out of touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
You're out of touch (You're soul alone)
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around"

Strangers making the most of the dark
Two by two their bodies become one

I see you through the smokey air
Can't you feel the weight of my stare
You're so close but still a world away
What I'm dying to say, is that

I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you, crazy for you

Trying hard to control my heart
I walk over to where you are
Eye to eye we need no words at all

Slowly now we begin to move
Every breath I'm deeper into you
Soon we two are standing still in time
If you read my mind, you'll see

I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
You'll feel it in my kiss

And yet, I'm still afraid to let it flow
What started out as friendship, has grown stronger
I only wish I had the strength to let it show
I tell myself that I can't hold out forever
I said there is no reason for my fear
'Cause I feel so secure when we're together
You give my life direction
You make everything so clear

And even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars, forever
Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore

My life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you
I've been running round in circles in my mind
And it always seems that I'm following you, girl
'Cause you take me to the places that, alone, I'd never find

You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night

(The camera pans around the place. No one is home.)
Radio: October is inventory time. So right now, Statler Toyota is making the best deals of the year on all 1985 model Toyotas. You won't find a better car with a better price with better service anywhere in Hill Valley...
Television: The Senate is expected to vote on this today. In other news, officials at The Pacific Nuclear Research Facility have denied the rumor that the case of missing plutonium was in fact stolen from their vault two weeks ago. A Libyan terrorist group had claimed responsibility for the alleged theft, however, the officials now infer the crepency to a simple clerical error. The FBI...
(The door opens and Marty McFly walks in, his skateboard rolls to a stop by the bed. Under the bed we can see a box that is marked Plutonium.)
Marty: Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on?
(He looks around and realizes that no one is home. He decides to test out the Amps. He hooks up his guitar and turns the amp all the way up. He hits one note and the speakers blow out, throwing him back into some boxes.)
Marty: Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. (the phone begins to ring. He answers it.) Yo.
Doc: (on phone) Marty, is that you?
Marty: Hey, hey, Doc, where are you?
Doc: (on phone) Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance.
Marty: Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning?
Doc: (on phone) Yeah.
Marty: What's going on? Where have you been all week?
Doc: (on phone) Working.
Marty: Where's Einstein, is he with you?
Doc: (on phone) Yeah, he's right here.
Marty: You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week.
Doc: (on phone) My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload.
Marty: Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.
Doc: (on phone) Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall.
Marty: Right.
(All of a sudden all the clocks in the room begin going off. It's very loud.)
Doc: (on phone) Are those my clocks I hear?
Marty: Yeah, it's 8:00.
Doc: (on phone) They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow.
Marty: Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25?
Doc: (on phone) Precisely.
Marty: Damn. I'm late for school.
(Hangs up the phone and heads out. He grabs on to the tail end of a car and rides his skateboard to school.)
(School)
(Marty arrives but his girlfriend, Jennifer, is waiting for him.)
Marty: Hello, Jennifer.
Jennifer: Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you're caught it'll be four tardies in a row.
(Hallway)
Jennifer: Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe.
Marty: Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow.
Strickland: Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nuttcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble.
Marty: Oh yes sir.
Strickland: You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went here. He was a slacker too.
Marty: Can I go now, Mr. Strickland?
Strickland: I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother McFly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley.
Marty: Yeah, well history is gonna change.
(Auditorium - After school)
(Marty's band is getting ready to try out.)
Audition Judge: Next, please.
Marty: Alright, we're the Pinheads.
(They begin to play the opening to ""Power of Love"" by Huey Lewis and the News.)
Audition Judge: Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please?
(Town Square)
(Marty and Jennifer are sitting on a bench near the Clock Tower.)
Election Van: Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name.
Marty: I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody.
Jennifer: Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world.
Marty: Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music.
Jennifer: But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying.
Marty: Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything.
Jennifer: That's good advice, Marty.
Marty: Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, ""Get out of here, kid, you got no future."" I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man.
Jennifer: C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night.
Marty: (spots a really sweet looking Truck.) Check out that four by four. That is hot. Someday, Jennifer, someday. Wouldn't it be great to take that truck up to the lake? Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back. Lie out under the stars.
Jennifer: Stop it.
Marty: What?
Jennifer: Does your mom know about tomorrow night?
Marty: No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun.
Jennifer: She's just trying to keep you respectable.
Marty: Well, she's not doing a very good job.
(They go to kiss but a woman shoves a flyer in their faces.)
Woman: Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage.
Marty: Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. (drops a quarter into her collection tin.)
Woman: Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer.
Marty: Right.
Woman: (walks off) Save the clock tower.
Marty: Where were we?
Jennifer: Right about here.
(They kiss right as Jennifer's Dad drives up.)
Jennifer's Dad: Jennifer.
Jennifer: It's my dad.
Marty: Right.
Jennifer: I've gotta go.
Marty: I'll call you tonight.
Jennifer: I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. (writes the number on the back of the Clock Tower flyer.) Bye.
(Marty's House)
Marty: Perfect, just perfect.
(Marty arrives in time to see a Tow Truck driving up with what's left of his Dad's Car. Inside Biff Tannen is griping at George McFly, Marty's father. George is a skinny man, and very nerdy.)
Biff: I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed.
George: Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blind spot before when I would drive it. (spots Marty) Hi, son.
Biff: But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there?
George: Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage?
Biff: My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill?
George: Uh?
Biff: And where's my reports?
George: Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till…
Biff: Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? (George doesn't say anything.) Would you?
George: Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright?
Biff: Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. (George looks down and Biff smacks his head.) Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. (Goes to the fridge to get a beer.) I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead? Say hi to your mom for me. (leaves)
George: (turns to see Marty's disappointed expression) I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations.
Marty: The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue?
George: I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry.
(Dinner Table - Later)
(The whole family is having dinner. George is working on his reports and watching TV. David and Linda, Marty's siblings are there as well. David is dressed in his work clothes, a fast food restaurant outfit.)
George: Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance.
David: He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches.
(Marty's mother, Loraine, enters and drops a cake onto the table. She's a plump woman who tends to drink somewhat.)
Lorraine: Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line.
Marty: Uncle Jailbird Joey?
David: He's your brother, Mom.
Linda: Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison.
Lorraine: We all make mistakes in life, children.
David: God dammit, I'm late.
Lorraine: David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here.
David: C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. (kisses George's head.) Woo, time to change that oil.
(George laughs at that.)
Linda: Hey Marty, I'm not your answering service, but you're outside pouting about the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice.
Lorraine: I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble.
Linda: Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy.
Lorraine: I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy.
Linda: Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody.
Lorraine: Well, it will just happen. Like the way I met your father.
Linda: That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car.
Lorraine: It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born.
Linda: Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street.
Lorraine: What was it, George, bird watching?
George: (looks up from the TV) What Lorraine, what?
Lorraine: Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him.
Linda: Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance.
Lorraine: No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him.
(Bedroom - 1:00 am)
(Marty's asleep in his clothes. The phone rings, and Marty wakes up and answers it.)
Doc: (on phone) Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you?
Marty: Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly.
Doc: Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall?
Marty: Um, yeah, I'm on my way.
(Twin Pines Mall)
(Marty shows up but doesn't see Doc. He walks over to Doc's dog, Einstein.)
Marty: Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc?
(Suddenly the back of an 18-wheeler opens up and Doc drives slowly out in the Delorean.)
Doc: Marty, you made it.
Marty: Yeah.
Doc: Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life.
Marty: Um, well it's a Delorean, right?
Doc: Bare with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed.
Marty: Doc, is that a de…
Doc: Never mind that now, never mind that now.
Marty: Alright, I'm ready.
Doc: Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. (gestures for Einstein to get into the car) C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it.
Marty: Whoa, whoa, okay.
Doc: Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch.
Marty: Right check, Doc.
Doc: Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head.
Marty: You have this thing hooked up to the car?
(The doc picks up a remote control device.)
Doc: Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. (The car heads straight for them picking up speed all the while. It hits 88 MPH just as it reaches them and it disappears. Leaving behind fire track marks on the pavement.) Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds.
Marty: Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein.
Doc: Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact.
Marty: Where the hell are they.
Doc: The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine.
Marty: Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of the Delorean? Doc: The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out! (he shoves Marty out of the way just as the car reappears. It's covered in ice.)
Marty: What, what is it hot?
Doc: It's cold, damn cold. (Doc opens the car door with his foot.) Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking.
Marty: He's alright.
Doc: He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. (leans into the car and points out the time circuit) First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tells you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You input the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955.
Marty: What, I don't get what happened.
Doc: That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porcelain was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. (motions to the flux capacitor.)This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor.
Marty: The flux capacitor.
Doc: It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.
Marty: This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline?
Doc: Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium.
Marty: Uh, plutonium, (lowers the camera) wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear?
Doc: Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. (Marty picks the camera up again) No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need.
Marty: Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off?
Doc: Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts.
Marty: Jesus.
Doc: Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload.
(A few minutes later both Doc and Marty are fully clothed in radiation suits. Doc injects a rod of plutonium into the Delorean, then removes his helmet.)
Doc: Safe now, everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. (goes to climb in the Delorean) Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics.
Marty: The future, it's where you're going?
Doc: That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series.
Marty: Uh, Doc.
Doc: Huh?
Marty: Uh, look me up when you get there.
Doc: Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of? I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back? One pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. (Einstein begins to whine) What is it Einy? (Spots the Libyans in their van) Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.
Marty: Who, who?
Doc: Who do you think, (points) the Libyans.
Marty: Holy shit.
Doc: Unroll their fire.
Marty: Doc, wait.
(The Libyans corner Doc and shoot him.)
Marty: No!! Bastards!! (They go after him and he jumps in the Delorean and takes off.)
Libyan: Go. Go. (they follow)
Marty: C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety. (floors the gas, and as soon as the car reaches 88 MPH he is sent back to 1955.)
Marty: Ahh. Ahh.
(Hill Valley Outskirts - 1955)
(Marty crashes into Old Man Peabody's Barn. The Peabody's wake up and rush out to the barn.)
Mother: Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa?
Father: Looks like a airplane, without wings.
Son: That ain't no airplane, look.
(Holds up his alien comic, which shows an alien craft that looks a lot like the Delorean. They all hold their breath as the door opens and Marty gets out. His radiation hood is over his face, and they think he's an alien.)
Mother & Father: Ahh.
Father: Children. (they high tale it out of the barn.)
Marty: Listen, woah. (he trips but gets back up.) Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn.
(Marty opens the barn door.)
Son: It's already mutated intro human form, shoot it.
Father: Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch. (Marty ducks and scrambles back into the Delorean. He takes off running over a pine on the way.) My pine, why you. You space bastard, you killed a pine.
(Road)
(Marty spots a sign for the neighborhood that he lives in. It's just about to be built.)
Marty: Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. (stops a car that's driving by) Woah, hey, listen, you gotta help me.
Woman: Don't stop, Wilbert, drive.
(They quickly drive off.)
Marty: Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon.
(Hill Valley)
(Marty wanders around and spots another Election Van driving around.)
Election Van: Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas...
(A man throws a newspaper away and Marty picks it up and sees the date as November 5th, 1955.)
Marty: This has gotta be a dream.
(He spots a coffee shop and goes in.)
(Coffee Shop)
Lou: Hey kid, what you do, jump ship?
Marty: What?
Lou: What's with the life preserver?
(Marty looks down at his jacket vest.)
Marty: I just wanna use the phone.
Lou: Yeah, it's in the back.
Marty: (goes and looks through the white pages in the phone book) Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. (He tries calling but there's no answer. So he goes over to the bar.) Do you know where 1640 Riverside…
Lou: Are you gonna order something, kid?
Marty: Yeah, gimme a Tab.
Lou: Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something.
Marty: Right, gimme a Pepsi free.
Lou: You wanna a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.
Marty: Well just gimme something without any sugar in it, okay?
Lou: Without any sugar.
(He gives Marty a cup of coffee and takes the money. Suddenly a younger Biff Tannen walks in.)
Biff: Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing.
(Marty turns, thinking they're talking to him.)
Marty: Biff.
(Biff ignores Marty and continues talking to the guy next to him.)
Biff: Hey I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug.
(Marty looks over and there sits his father.)
George: Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing?
Biff: Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly?
George: Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday…
Biff: Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you?
George: Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen.
Biff: Uh, no, no, no, no. (Notices that Marty is watching them.) What are you looking at, butt-head?
Guy 1: Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown.
Biff: Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly?
George: Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning.
Biff: Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly.
George: Okay.
Biff: I don't wanna see you in here again.
George: Yeah, alright, bye-bye. (goes back to eating his cereal, but sees Marty still watching him.) What?
Marty: You're George McFly.
George: Yeah, who are you?
Goldie: Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that?
George: Well, they're bigger than me.
Goldie: Stand tall, boy, have some respect for yourself. Don't you know that if you let people walk all over you know, they'll be walking all over you for the rest of your life? Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?
Lou: Watch it, Goldie.
Goldie: No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody.
Marty: That's right, he's gonna be mayor.
Goldie: Yeah, I'm…mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor.
Lou: A colored mayor, that'll be the day.
Goldie: You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers, I will be mayor and I'll be the most powerful mayor in the history of Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town.
Lou: Good, you could start by sweeping the floor.
Goldie: Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that.
(Marty smiles at that, and turns back to talk to George, but he's gone. He looks outside and sees George riding off on his bike, and he runs outside.)
Marty: Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike.
(Street)
(Marty spots his dad's bike leaning up against a tree, and looks up to see his father in the tree looking through a pair of binoculars. He looks to see what his father is looking at and sees a half-undressed girl through a bedroom window.)
Marty: He's a peeping tom. (George falls out of the tree and is about to be hit by an oncoming car.) Dad! (Marty shoves him out of the way and gets hit by the car himself.)
Sam: (to George) Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? (George grabs his bike and rides off.) Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house.
(Bedroom)
(Marty jerks awake. He's in a bed in a darkened room. He hears someone moving around.)
Marty: Mom, is that you?
Lorraine: There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now.
Marty: I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible.
Lorraine: Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955.
Marty: 1955? (he jerks up in bed just as Loraine turns on the light.) You're my mo…you're my mo….
Lorraine: My name's Lorraine. Lorraine Baines.
(She sits down on the opposite bed.)
Marty: Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin.
Lorraine: Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head.
Marty: Ah, where're my pants?
Lorraine: (points) Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin.
Marty: Calvin. Why do you keep calling me Calvin?
Lorraine: Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh?
Marty: Actually, people call me Marty.
Lorraine: Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. (she gets up and goes to sit next to him) Do you mind if I sit here?
Marty: No, fine, no , good, fine, good.
Lorraine: That's a big bruise you have there.
Marty: Ah. (he backs away from her touch and falls off the bed.)
(Lorraine's mother calls out from downstairs.)
Stella: Loraine, are you up there?
Lorraine: God, it's my mother. Put your pants back on.
(She throws his pants to him, and he catches them dropping the blanket in the process. She grins at him before ducking out of the room.)
(Downstairs)
(A few minutes later Marty is walking down the stairs with Lorraine and her mother.)
Stella: So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port?
Marty: Excuse me.
Stella: Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver.
Marty: Uh, coast guard.
Stella: Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god.
Sam: What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age.
Stella: Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey.
(Marty leans down to talk to Joey.)
Marty: So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.
Stella: Yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf.
Marty: Well, uh, listen, uh, I really…
Lorraine: (jerks Marty down into the chair next to her.) Sit here, Marty.
Stella: Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner.
(Sam pulls the TV into the doorway of the dining room.)
Sam: Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat.
Lorraine: Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television?
Marty: Well yeah, you know we have two of them.
Milton: Wow, you must be rich.
Stella: Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets.
Marty: Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space.
Milton: What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new.
Marty: Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun.
Milton: What's a rerun?
Marty: You'll find out.
Stella: You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother?
Marty: (glances at Lorraine) Yeah, I think maybe you do.
Stella: Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you.
Marty: You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home.
Stella: Oh.
Marty: Yet.
Stella: Oh.
Marty: Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is?
Sam: It's uh, the other end of town, a block past Maple.
Marty: A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive.
Sam: Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?
Lorraine: Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughtta spend the night? After all, Dad almost killed him with the car.
Stella: That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility.
Marty: Well gee, I don't know.
Lorraine: And he could sleep in my room. (she grabs Marty's thigh under the table.)
Marty: (jumps up) I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. (leaves)
Stella: He's a very strange young man.
Sam: He's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you.
(Doc's House)
(Instead of living in his small workshop, Doc now lives in a very large house. Marty knocks on the door. As he turns his back, waiting for Doc to answer the door, the door opens a crack and Doc peaks out. When Marty turns Doc slams the door shut.)
Marty: Doc?
(Doc opens the door fully now. He's got some strange contraption on his head. He pulls Marty into the living room.)
Doc: Don't say a word.
Marty: Doc.
Doc: I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything, anything about you.
Marty: Listen, Doc.
Doc: Quiet.
Marty: Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty.
Doc: Don't tell me anything.
(Doc puts a suction cup on Marty's forehead.)
Marty: Doc, you gotta help…
Doc: Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance?
Marty: Yeah, exactly.
Doc: Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post?
Marty: No.
Doc: Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary?
Marty: (he pulls the suction cup off his forehead) Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985.
Doc: (grabs Marty's shoulders) My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. (takes off the contraption.)
Marty: Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works.
Doc: Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine.
Marty: Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984.
(Doc takes the picture with a pair of tongs and looks at it.)
Doc: Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair.
(He tosses the photo back at Marty.)
Marty: I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me.
Doc: So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985?
Marty: Ronald Reagan.
Doc: Ronald Reagan? The actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? (he grabs some papers and runs outside towards his workshop) I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady.
Marty: Whoa, wait, Doc.
Doc: And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury.
Marty: Look, you gotta listen to me.
Doc: I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy. (he slams the workshop door in Marty's face.)
Marty: No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. You were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible.
(Doc swings the door open and looks at Marty with astonishment.)
(Workshop)
(Marty is rewinding the video he shot of the time travel test with 1985 Doc.)
Marty: Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it.
Doc: After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. (He holds up a crude drawing of the flux capacitor.)
Marty: Flux capacitor.
Doc: It works, (laughs), it works. I finally invent something that works.
Marty: Bet your ass it works.
Doc: Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home.
Marty: Okay Doc, this is it.
(1985 Doc pops up on the screen.)
1985 Doc: Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind…
Doc: Why that's me, look at me, I'm an old man.
1985 Doc: Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of…
Doc: Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing?
Marty: Well, this is a radiation suit.
Doc: Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television.
Marty: whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc.
1985 Doc: No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity…
Doc: What did I just say?
(Marty rewinds the tape and plays it again.)
1985 Doc: No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need.
Doc: One point twenty-one gigawatts! One point twenty-one gigawatts! Great Scott. (runs out of the workshop.)
Marty: (calling after him) What the hell is a gigawatt?
(House)
(Doc is now sitting in an armchair.)
Doc: How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. (he picks up a photo and starts talking to it.) Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't.
(Marty comes in.)
Marty: Doc, look, all we need is a little plutonium.
Doc: I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here.
Marty: Whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl.
Doc: Is she pretty?
Marty: Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. (shows Doc what Jennifer wrote on the back of the Clock Tower flier.) That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope.
Doc: Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.
Marty: What did you say?
Doc: A bolt of lightning, unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna strike.
Marty: We do now.
(He holds out the flier and Doc takes it and reads it.)
Doc: This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future.
Marty: Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around.
Doc: Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand?
Marty: Yeah, sure, okay.
Doc: Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me?
Marty: (guiltily) Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents.
Doc: Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. (Marty gives it to him) Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother.
Marty: His head's gone, it's like it's been erased.
Doc: Erased from existence.
(School)
(Marty and Doc walk up to the school.)
Marty: Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new.
Doc: Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next.
Marty: This sounds pretty heavy.
Doc: Weight has nothing to do with it.
(Hallway)
Doc: Which one's your pop?
Marty: That's him.
(Marty points out George who's walking down the hall. He has a 'kick me' sign on his back and guys keep going by and kicking him in the butt.)
George: Okay, okay you guys, oh ha ha ha very funny. Hey you guys are being real mature.
Doc: Maybe you were adopted.
George: Okay, real mature guys. (He drops his books.) Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books?
Strickland: McFly.
Marty: That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?
Strickland: Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life?
George: No.
Doc: What did your mother ever see in that kid?
Marty: I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car…(pause)…hit me with the car.
Doc: That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid.
(Marty walks over to George.)
Marty: Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day.
George: Yeah.
Marty: Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. (he takes George over to where Lorraine is at her locker.) Lorraine.
Lorraine: (surprised) Calvin.
Marty: I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly.
George: (tries to make a move on her) Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you.
Lorraine: (to Marty) How's your head?
Marty: Well uh, good, fine.
Lorraine: Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? (the bell rings) I'm sorry I have to go. (to her friends as she passes by Doc) Isn't he a dream boat?
Marty: Doc, she didn't even look at him.
Doc: This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father.
Marty: Whoa, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that my mother has got the hots for me?
Doc: Precisely.
Marty: Whoa, this is heavy.
Doc: There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?
Marty: What?
Doc: The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social…
Marty: What, well you mean like a date?
Doc: Right.
Marty: What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties?
Doc: Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are there common interests? What do they like to do together?
Marty: Nothing.
Doc: Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.
Marty: Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time.
Doc: Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance.
(Lunchroom)
(Marty sits down across from George at a table. George is writing in a notebook.)
Marty: George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Loraine. What are you writing?
George: Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet.
Marty: Get out of town, I didn't know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some. (he reaches for the notebook, but George jerks it back.)
George: Oh, no no no, I never uh, I never let anybody read my stories.
Marty: Why not?
George: Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand.
Marty: (thinks about his band audition) Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Loraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance.
George: Really.
Marty: Oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her.
George: What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What is she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else.
Marty: Who?
George: (points over at Lorraine's table.) Biff.
(Biff is sitting at Lorraine's table, and he's trying to grope her.)
Biff: C'mon, c'mon.
Lorraine: Leave me alone.
Biff: You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you.
Lorraine: (she slaps him) Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl.
Biff: Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet.
Lorraine: Get your meat hooks off of me.
Marty: You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, (Biff stands up and he's at least a foot taller than Marty) uh please.
Biff: So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a… (spots Strickland over Marty's shoulder) since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here.
(Street)
(George is walking home and Marty catches up to him.)
Marty: George.
George: Why do you keep following me around?
Marty: Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life.
George: But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater.
Marty: Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break.
George: Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.
(He runs inside his house and shuts the door behind him.)
Marty: (to himself) Science Fiction Theater.
(George's Room - Night)
(Marty arrives in his radiation suit and helmet. He places headphones on George's head as he sleeps, and then pops a Van Halen tape into the walkman and presses play. George wakes up with a jerk, holding his head.)
George: Who are you?
(Marty presses play again and George falls silent.)
Marty: Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan.
(George turns and looks at the cover of a book that's by his head, and the alien looks almost exactly like Marty does in his radiation suit.)
(Gas Station - Day)
(Marty is trying to open up a bottle of Coke. George runs up. He's very disheveled.)
George: Marty. Marty. Marty.
Marty: Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day?
George: I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Loraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it.
Marty: Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the café. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George?
(George takes the bottle of Coke and opens it for Marty. They begin walking over to the Café.)
George: Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain.
Marty: Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay?
George: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Marty: Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her.
George: Okay, but I don't know what to say.
Marty: Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the first thing that comes to your mind.
George: Nothing's coming to my mind.
Marty: Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born.
George: What, what?
Marty: Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, (George takes out a pad of paper and begins to write this all down.)…tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George?
George: I'm writing this down, this is good stuff.
Marty: Yeah okay.
George: Oh.
Marty: Let's go.
George: Oh.
(Coffee Shop)
(They enter the coffee shop.)
Marty: Will you take care of that?
George: Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. (he takes a drink and then goes over to Lorraine's table.) Lorraine, my density has popped me to you.
Lorraine: What?
George: Oh, what I meant to day was…
Lorraine: Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?
George: Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and you're my density. I mean, I'm your destiny.
Lorraine: Oh.
(Biff and his friends walk in.)
Biff: Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you?
George: Well, Biff.
Biff: Alright, punk, now…
Marty: Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that?
(Marty runs out.)
Lorraine: That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream.
(Outside)
(Marty runs over to a kid who's on a scooter.)
Marty: Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop.
Kid: Hey.
Marty: I'll get it back to you, alright?
(Marty breaks off the top part of the scooter, leaving a 1955 version of a skateboard. He takes off on it.)
Kid: You broke it. Wow, look at him go.
Biff: Let's get him.
Girl: What's that thing he's on?
Boy: It's a board with wheels.
Lorraine: He's an absolute dream.
(Biff and his friends hop into Biff's car and take off after Marty. They manage to catch up to him. He's on his board right in front of their car. He holds on to the hood since he can't get away.)
Marty: Ah. Whoa.
(Biff spots a manure truck and heads straight for it.)
Biff: I'm gonna ram him.
(Marty manages to get out of the way, and Biff heads straight for the manure truck.)
Biff & his friends: Shit.
(They hit the truck and it dumps a load of manure into the car and onto them. Marty walks over to the kid he borrowed the 'skateboard' from and gives it back to him.)
Marty: Thanks a lot, kid.
Biff: I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch.
(Everyone is standing outside of the Coffee Shop talking about what just happened.)
Girlfriend #1: Where does he come from?
Girlfriend #2: Yeah, where does he live?
Lorraine: I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.
(Doc's Workshop)
(Doc is watching the video of 1985 Doc. Marty walks in and sees him.)
1985 Doc: My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.
Marty: Doc.
Doc: Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit.
Marty: Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape.
Doc: Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny.
Marty: You don't understand.
Doc: I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours.
Marty: You're…you're right.
Doc: Let me show you my plan for sending you home. (Walks over to a very nice model of the town of Hill Valley.) Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it.
Marty: Its good.
Doc: Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the Clock Tower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at 10:04 PM lightning will strike the Clock Tower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. (Marty releases the car. It races down the main street in the model. When it hits the 'wire' Doc has hooked up it accelerates. It flies off the table in flames and lands in a pile of rags, setting them on fire.) Huhh. (Doc quickly races to put the fire out.)
Marty: You instill me with a lot of confidence, Doc.
Doc: Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your Pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out?
Marty: Uh, I think so.
Doc: What did she say?
(There's a knock at the door before Marty can answer. Doc goes to see who it is.)
Doc: It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine.
(They cover the Delorean with a sheet and Doc opens the door. Lorraine walks in a little nervously until she spots Marty.)
Lorraine: Hi, Marty.
Marty: Uh, Loraine. How did you know I was here?
Lorraine: I followed you.
Marty: Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown.
Lorraine: Hi.
Marty: Hello.
Lorraine: Marty, this may seem a little forward, but I was wondering if you would ask me to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance on Saturday.
Marty: Uh, you mean nobody's asked you?
Lorraine: No, not yet.
Marty: What about George?
Lorraine: George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you?
Marty: Yeah.
(Saturday Morning)
(George's Backyard)
(George is hanging up laundry.)
George: I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you.
Marty: Cause, George, she wants to go to the dance with you, she just doesn't know it yet. That's why we got to show her that you, George McFly, are a fighter. You're somebody who's gonna stand up for yourself, someone who's gonna protect her.
George: Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life.
Marty: Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be.
George: I'm gonna be at the dance.
Marty: Right, and where am I gonna be?
George: You're gonna be in the car with her.
Marty: Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me.
George: Why is she gonna get angry with you?
Marty: Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them.
George: Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her…
Marty: No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say…(pause while he waits for George to say something) …your line, George.
George: Oh, uh, hey you, get your damn hands off her. (pause) Do you really think I oughta swear?
Marty: Yes, definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I'm out for the count, right? And you and Loraine live happily ever after.
George: Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared.
Marty: George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self-confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything.
(Saturday Night)
(Main Street)
(Doc and Marty are setting up the Delorean for the trip back to 1985.)
Radio: This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties.
Doc: Are you sure about this storm?
Marty: When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future.
Doc: You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to se 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I could talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.
Marty: I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future…
Doc: No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time.
(Coffee Shop)
(Marty is writing Doc a letter.)
Marty: Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.
(Main Street)
Cop: Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire?
Doc: Oh, just a little weather experiment.
Cop: What you got under here?
Doc: Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment.
Cop: You got a permit for that?
Doc: Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it.
(While Doc isn't looking Marty slips the letter into the pocket of his jacket, then he leaves to pick up Lorraine.)
(School Parking Lot)
(Marty and Lorraine arrive at the dance. Marty's very nervous.)
Marty: Do you mind if we park for a while?
Lorraine: That's a great idea. I'd love to park.
Marty: Huh?
Lorraine: Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before.
Marty: (shocked) What?
Lorraine: (takes her jacket off, and her dress shows a bit of cleavage) Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong?
Marty: (looks away) No no. (looks back to see Lorraine take a drink of alcohol from a flask she had in her purse.) Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing?
Lorraine: I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet.
Marty: Yeah well, you shouldn't drink.
Lorraine: Why not?
Marty: Because, you might regret it later in life.
Lorraine: Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.
(He goes to take a drink but spits it out when she lights a cigarette.)
Marty: Jesus, you smoke too?
Lorraine: Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother.
(The Dance)
(George is off to the side dancing by himself.)
Marvin Barry: We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where.
(The Parking Lot)
Lorraine: Marty, why are you so nervous?
Marty: Loraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it?
Lorraine: Oh, you mean how you're supposed to act on a first date.
Marty: Ah well, sort of.
Lorraine: I think I know exactly what you mean.
Marty: You do?
Lorraine: You know what I do in those situations?
Marty: What?
Lorraine: I don't worry. (she leans over and kisses him, then leans back with a weird look on her face.) This is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?
Marty: Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense.
Lorraine: Someone's coming.
(Marty thinks it's George, but is surprised when the car door is jerked open and Biff drags him out of the car.)
Biff: You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him.
Lorraine: Let him go, Biff, you're drunk.
Biff: Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me.
Lorraine: Stop it.
Biff: C'mon.
Lorraine: Stop it.
Biff: C'mon.
Marty: Leave her alone, you bastard.
Biff: You guys, take him in back and I'll be right there. Well c'mon, this ain't no peep show.
(The guys drag Marty off.)
(Back of the Auditorium)
(Biff's guys run up and dump Marty in the trunk of a car.)
Guy 1: Let's put him in there.
Guy 2: Yeah.
Guy 1: That's for messing up my hair.
(They slam the trunk shut and one of the band members gets out of the car.)
Starlighter: What the hell you doing to my car?
Guy 2: Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you.
Marvin Barry: Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood.
Guy 1: Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? (they run off)
Marty: (in the trunk) C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo.
Marvin Barry: Lorenzo, where're you keys?
Marty: The keys are in the trunk.
Marvin Barry: Say that again.
Marty: I said the keys are in here.
(Parking Lot)
(George runs out to the car where Loraine is and jerks the car door open.)
George: Hey you, get your damn hands off…(sees that it's BifF) oh.
Biff: I think you got the wrong car, McFly.
Lorraine: George, help me, please.
Biff: Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it.
George: No, Biff, you leave her alone.
Biff: Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it.
(Biff grabs George's arm and twists it.)
Lorraine: Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop.
(Back of the Auditorium)
Marvin Barry: Give me a hand, Lorenzo. (Pops the trunk open) Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand.
(Marty quickly climbs out.)
Marty: Who's are these? (tosses the keys to one of the guys)
Starlighter: Thanks, thanks a lot.
(Parking Lot)
Lorraine: You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go.
(Biff shoves her down, and George watches in horror. George then doubles up his fist when Biff isn't looking and when Biff looks back George decks him. Biff falls down and is out cold. George can't believe what he did. Then he holds out a hand to Loraine.)
George: Are you okay?
(Lorraine takes his hand and he helps her up. They walk off into the dance.)
Girlfriend: Who is that guy.
Boyfriend: That's George McFly.
Girlfriend: That's George McFly?
Marty: Excuse me.
(Main Street)
(The wind picks up and thunder rolls.)
Doc: The storm.
(Back of the Auditorium)
(The guys from the band are still outside trying to figure out what to do since Marvin's hand is busted up.)
Marty: Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance.
Starlighter: Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him.
Marty: Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history.
Marvin Barry: Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar.
(The Dance)
(Marty is up on stage with the Band playing the guitar. They're playing 'Earth Angel'.)
Marvin Barry: This is for all you lovers out there.
Lorraine: George, aren't you gonna kiss me?
George: I, I don't know.
(This kid cuts in on George and Loraine. Marty begins to disappear.)
Kid: Scram, McFly.
Starlighter: (to Marty) Hey boy, are you alright?
Marty: I can't play.
Lorraine: George. George.
Marty: George.
George: (to kid) Excuse me. (he shoves the kid out of the way and kisses Loraine.)
(Marty comes back and both his brother and sister show up in the picture again.)
Marvin Barry: Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one.
Marty: Uh, well, I gotta go.
Marvin Barry: C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks.
Marty: Something that really cooks. (to audience) Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. (to band) Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. (they begin to play 'Johnny Be Good')
Boyfriend: Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going.
Girlfriend: George you ever think of running for class president?
(Marvin goes backstage and makes a phone call.)
Marvin Barry: (into phone) John, John, its' your cousin. Your cousin Marvin Barry, you know that new sound you're lookin for, well listen to this.
(Marty finishes the song with a wild guitar solo. Everyone stops dancing and stares at him.)
Marty: I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.
(Side Door)
Marty: Lorraine.
Lorraine: Marty, that was very interesting music.
Marty: Uh, yeah.
Lorraine: I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home.
Marty: Great good, good, Loraine, I had a feeling about you two.
Lorraine: I have a feeling too.
Marty: Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational.
Lorraine: Marty, will we ever see you again?
Marty: I guarantee it.
George: Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advise, I'll never forget it.
Marty: Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids (Lorraine blushes) and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him.
George: Okay.
(Marty leaves)
Lorraine: Marty, such a nice name.
(Main Street)
Doc: Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. (Marty shows up.) You're late, do you have no concept of time?
Marty: Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked.
Doc: What?
Marty: He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life.
Doc: Never?
Marty: No, why, what's a matter?
Doc: Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas.
Marty: Right.
Doc: Well, I guess that's everything.
Marty: Thanks.
Doc: Thank you. In about thirty years.
Marty: I hope so.
Doc: Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine.
Marty: Right.
(Doc puts his hands in his pockets. He feels the letter and pulls it out. He looks at it then holds it out to Marty.)
Doc: What's the meaning of this.
Marty: You'll find out in thirty years.
Doc: It's about the future, isn't it?
Marty: Wait a minute.
Doc: It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous.
Marty: Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it.
Doc: No, I refuse to except the responsibility.
(Doc rips up the letter.)
Marty: In that case, I'll tell you strait out.
(But before Marty can tell Doc what's going to happen in the future lightening strikes a tree and a limb falls down and unplugs the cable that runs from the clock tower to the cable in the middle of the street.)
Doc: Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you.
Marty: Right, I got it.
Doc: Ahh.
Marty: Doc.
(Doc climbs up to the top of the Clock Tower so they can fix the cable.)
Doc: C'mon, c'mon let's go.
Marty: (ties the rope to the cable) Alright, take it up, go. Doc.
(Doc lifts the cable up. Since Doc is at the top of the Clock Tower he can't hear what Marty is saying.)
Doc: Huh?
Marty: I have to tell you about the future.
Doc: Huh?
Marty: I have to tell you about the future.
(Doc almost falls off the Clock Tower.)
Doc: Ahh.
Marty: On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc.
Doc: Ohh, no.
Marty: No, Doc.
Doc: Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry.
Marty: Yeah.
(Down the Street)
(Marty reaches the white line, and stops the car. He hops out and attaches the hook to the back of the car and then climbs back into the Delorean.)
Marty: Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. (the car dies) No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon. (the car starts. The alarm goes off and Marty floors it.)
(Main Street)
(Doc just manages to get the cables hooked up correctly as the Delorean comes rushing down the street. Just as he gets the cables together the lightening strikes and passes through the cable and he's thrown back.)
Doc: Ahh.
(In the Delorean)
Marty: Doc.
(Main Street)
(Marty hits 88 MPH and disappears into the future.)
Doc: Yeah!!
(Main Street - 1985)
Red: Crazy drunk drivers.
Marty: Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. (the car has died again) No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans.
(Marty takes off running and reaches the Mall just as his other self sees Doc get shot.)
Marty #1: No, bastards.
(The other Marty jumps into the Delorean and takes off.)
Libyan: Go.
(Our Marty watches as the Delorean hits 88 MPH and takes off into the past. He runs over to Doc who is laying, unmoving, on the ground.)
Marty: Doc, Doc. Oh, no. (The Doc sits up behind him. Marty turns and sees that Doc is alive.) You're alive. (Doc pulls down zipper on his jump suit to reveal a bullet proof vest.) Bullet proof vest? How did you know? (Doc pulls out the letter that has been taped back together.) I never got a chance to tell you. What about all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum?
Doc: Well, I figured, what the hell.
(Marty's House)
(Doc has dropped Marty off.)
Marty: About how far ahead are you going?
Doc: About 30 years, it's a nice round number.
Marty: Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47.
Doc: I will.
Marty: Take care.
Doc: You too.
Marty: Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy.
Doc: You bet.
(Doc drives off and Marty heads inside his house.)
(The Next Day)
(Marty wakes up in his bed.)
Marty: What a nightmare.
(He gets up and walks into the living room and does a double take. Everything has completely changed. Everything is now upscale. Linda and David are both dressed for work. They're wearing suits.)
Linda: Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight.
David: Linda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago.
Linda: Now which one was it, Greg or Craig?
David: I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends.
Marty: What the hell is this?
Linda: Breakfast.
David: What did you sleep in your clothes again last night.
Marty: Yeah, yeah what are you wearing, Dave.
David: Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright?
Marty: Yeah.
(Lorraine and George walk in the back door. Lorraine is skinny and they both look great.)
Lorraine: I think we need a rematch.
George: Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating?
Lorraine: No.
George: Hello.
Lorraine: Good morning.
Marty: Mom, Dad. (he falls over)
Lorraine: Marty, are you alright?
George: Did you hurt your head?
(Marty gets back up.)
Marty: You guys look great. Mom, you look so thin.
Lorraine: Why thank you, Marty. (George walks around her and as he does he pats her on the bottom.) George. Good morning, sleepyhead. Good morning, Dave, Linda.
David: Good morning, Mom.
Linda: Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called.
Lorraine: Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date?
Marty: What, what, ma?
Lorraine: Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks.
Marty: Well, ma, we talked about this, we're not gonna go to the lake, the car's wrecked.
George: Wrecked?
David: Wrecked? When did this happen?
George: Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine.
David: Why am I always the last one to know about these things?
(George goes over and opens the front door to reveal Biff waxing the undamaged car.)
George: See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.
Biff: Just finishing up the second coat now.
George: Now Biff, don't con me.
Biff: I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat.
George: That Biff, what a character. (goes back inside) Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him…
Loraine: We never would have fallen in love.
George: That's right.
(Suddenly Biff runs in carrying a box.)
Biff: Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book.
Loraine: Ah, honey, your first novel.
George: Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything.
Biff: Oh, oh Marty, here's you keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight.
Marty: Keys?
(Garage)
(Marty walks out to the garage. He finds a brand new black four by four. Just like the one he was admiring a few days ago. Jennifer walks up.)
Jennifer: How about a ride, Mister?
Marty: Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you.
Jennifer: Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week.
Marty: I haven't.
Jennifer: You okay, is everything alright?
Marty: Aw yeah, everything is great.
(Suddenly there is a flash of light and Doc pulls into the driveway in the Delorean. He hops out and runs over to Marty.)
Doc: Marty you gotta come back with me.
Marty: Where?
Doc: Back to the future.
(Doc goes over to the garbage can and starts digging through it.)
Marty: Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc?
(Doc holds up some trash.)
Doc: I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car.
(He begins dumping the trash into Mr. Fusion.)
Marty: No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin.
Doc: Well, bring her along. This concerns her too.
Marty: Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something?
Doc: No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids.
(They all climb into the car. And Doc backs up into the street.)
Marty: Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88.
Doc: Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads.
(Doc pulls his sunglasses down and hits a button. Suddenly the car is airborne. They take off."

If I'm with friends and we should meet
Just pass me by, don't even speak

Have a male friend to ask for me

Ohhh yeah
Work, work

Somebody told me
""Boy, everything she wants, is everything she sees""
I guess I must have loved you
Because I said you were the perfect girl for me, maybe
But now we're six months older
And everything you want, and everything you see
Is out of reach, not good enough
I don't know what the hell you want from me, oh

Somebody tell me, Oh
(Won't you tell me)
Why I work so hard for you?
(To give you money, all to give you money)

Some people work for a living
Some people work for fun
Girl, I just work for you
They told me marriage was a give, and take
Well you've shown me you can take, you've got some giving to do
And now you tell me that you're having my baby
I'll tell you that I'm happy if you want me to
But one step further, and my back will break
If my best isn't good enough
Than how can it be good enough for two?
I can't work any harder than I do

Oh, why do I do the things I do?
I'd tell you if I knew
My God, I don't even think that I love you

Won't you tell me
Give you money, all to give you money
Oh ohh, Oh Yea
Tell me, tell me

How could you settle for a boy like me
When all I could see was the end of the week
All the things we sign
And the things we buy
Ain't gonna keep us together
It's just a matter of time

My situation, never changes
Walking in , and out of that door
Like a stranger, but the wages
I give you all, you say you want more
And all I can see was the end of the week
All the things we sign
And the things we buy
Ain't gonna keep us together
Girl, it's just a matter of time
Just a matter of...

Oh, why do I do the things I do?
I'd tell you if I knew
My God, I don't even think that I love you
Oh, why do I do the things I do?
I'd tell you if I knew
My God, I don't even think that I love you
Somebody tell me, want you to tell me

The night rolls in
You can feel it
Starting all over again
The moon comes up
And the music calls
You're getting tired of
Staring at the same four walls
You're out of your room
And down on the street
Moving through the crowd
In the midnight heat
The traffic roars
The sirens scream
You look at the faces
It's just like a dream
Nobody knows where you're going
Nobody cares where you've been

Cause you belong to the city
You belong to the night
Living in a river of darkness
Beneath the neon light
You were born in the city
Concrete under your feet
It's in your moves
It's in your blood
You're a man of the street

When you said goodbye
You were on the run
Trying to get away
From the things you've done
Now you're back again
And you're feeling strange
So much has happened
But nothing has changed
You still don't know
Where you're going
You're still just a face in the crowd

Cause you belong to the city
You belong to the night
Living in a river of darkness
Beneath the neon light
You were born in the city
Concrete under your feet
It's in your moves
It's in your blood
You're a man of the street

You can feel it
You can taste it
You can see it
You can face it
You can hear it
You're getting near it
You wanna make it
Cause you can take it
(Alternate Chorus)
You belong to the city
You belong to the night
You belong to the city
You belong to the night
You belong
You belong"

Still overseas, could it be the whole Earth opening wide
A sacred why, a mystery gaping inside
A week is why, until we...

Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
To fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire

The choice for you is the view to a kill
Between the shades assassination standing still
Earth's crystal tears, the fall of snowflakes on your body
First time in years to drench your skin in lover's rosy stain
A chance to find the phoenix for the flame
A chance to die, but can we...

Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
To fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need

On their way back from the fire
In august moon's surrender to
A dust cloud on the rise
Wild boys fallen far from glory
Reckless and so hungered
On the razors edge you trail
Because there's murder by the roadside
In a sore afraid new world

They tried to break us
Looks like they'll try again

Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always shine

You got sirens for a welcome
There's bloodstain for your pain
And your telephone been ringing while
You're dancing in the rain
Wild boys wonder where is glory
Where is all you angels
Now the figureheads have fell
And lovers war with arrows over
Secrets they could tell
Pre-Chorus
They tried to tame you
Looks like they'll try again

Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always shine

Many times, I tried to tell you
Many times, I cried alone
Always I'm surprised how well you
Cut my feelin's to the bone
Don't wanna leave you really
I've invested too much time
To give you up that easy
To the doubts that complicate your mind

We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words, we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace, for worse or for better
We belong, we belong, we belong together

Maybe it's a sign of weakness
When I don't know what to say
Maybe I just wouldn't know
What to do with my strength anyway
Have we become a habit?
Do we distort the facts?
Now, there's no looking forward
Now, there's no turning back
When you say

We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words, we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace, for worse or for better
We belong, we belong, we belong together

Close your eyes and try to sleep now
Close your eyes and try to dream
Clear your mind and do your best
To try and wash the palette clean
We can't begin to know it
How much we really care
I hear your voice inside me
I see your face everywhere, still you say

We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words, we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace, for worse or for better
We belong, we belong, we belong together
We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words, we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace, for worse or for better
We belong, we belong, we belong together

Seems that I was busy doing something close to nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door
She wore a...

Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

Built like she was
She had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm
So, look here
I put her on the back of my bike
And-a we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm
I said now, overcast days never turned me on
But something about the clouds and her mixed
She wasn't too bright
But I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how to get her kicks
She wore a...

Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
You feel like a movie star
Listen, they say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell you, if I had the chance to do it all again
I wouldn't change a stroke
'Cause baby I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then

Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret

Smiling at everyone

I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said
“Don't look back, you can never look back”
I thought I knew what love was, what did I know?
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but...

And the city don't know
What the city is getting
The creme de la creme of
The chess world in a show
With everything
But Yul Brynner
Times flies -
Doesn't seem a minute
Since the Tirolean Spa
Had the chess boys in it
All change - don't you know that when you play at this level
There's no ordinary venue
It's Iceland or the Philippines or Hastings or...
Or this place!
One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
And if you're lucky then the God's a she
I can feel an angel sliding up to me
One town's very like another when your head's down
Over your pieces
Brother
It's a drag
It's a bore
It's really such a pity
To be looking at the board not looking at the city
Whaddya mean? You've seen one crowded
Polluted
Stinking town
Tea
Girls
Warm and sweet
Warm
Sweet
Some are set up in the Somerset Maugham suite
Get Thai'd! You're talking to a tourist
Whose every moves's among the purest
I get my kicks above the waistline
Sunshine
One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walkin' next to me
Siam's gonna be the witness
To the ultimate test of cerebral fitness
This grips me more than would a muddy old river
Or reclining Buddah
And thank God I'm only watching the game
Controlling it
I don't see you guys rating the kind of mate
I'm contemplating
I'd let you watch I would invite you
But the queens we use would not excite you
So you'd better go back to your bars
Your temples
Your massage parlors
One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a God in every golden cloister
A little flesh
A little history
I can feel an angel sliding up to me
One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble"

There's gotta be something better out there

I wanted to be with you alone
And talk about the weather
But traditions I can trace against the child in your face
Won't escape my attention
You keep your distance with a system of touch
And gentle persuasion
I'm lost in admiration - could I need you this much?
Oh, you're wasting my time
You're just, just, just wasting time

Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Ah, don't take my heart, don't break my heart
Don't, don't, don't throw it away

Throw it away
Throw it away

I made a fire, I’m watching it burn
I thought of your future
With one foot in the past now just how long will it last?
No, no, no, have you no ambition?
My mother and my brother’s used to breathing clean air
Nothing ever changes when you’re acting your age
And dreaming I’m a doctor
Nothing gets done when you feel like a baby
It’s hard to be a man when there’s a gun in your hand
Nothing ever changes when you’re acting your age
Oh, I feel so

Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Ah, don't take my heart, don't break my heart
Don't, don't, don't throw it away

And this is my four leaf clover
I’m on the line, one open mind

Back in high school
He could throw that speedball by you
Make you look like a fool boy
Saw him the other night at this roadside bar
I was walking in, he was walking out
We went back inside sat down had a few drinks
But all he kept talking about was

Glory days, well they'll pass you by
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days

Well there's a girl that lives up the block
Back in school she could turn all the boy's heads
Sometimes on a Friday I'll stop by
And have a few drinks after she put her kids to bed
Her and her husband Bobby well they split up
I guess it's two years gone by now
We just sit around talking about the old times
She says when she feels like crying
She starts laughing thinking bout

Glory days, well they'll pass you by
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days

My old man worked 20 years on the line
And they let him go
Now everywhere he goes out looking for work
They just tell him that he's too old
I was 9 nine years old and he was working at the
Metuchen Ford plant assembly line
Now he just sits on a stool down at the Legion hall
But I can tell what's on his mind

Glory days yeah goin back
Glory days aw he ain't never had
Glory days, glory days

In fact I think I'm going down to the well tonight
And I'm gonna drink till I get my fill
And I hope when I get old I don't sit around thinking about it
But I probably will
Yeah, just sitting back trying to recapture
A little of the glory yeah
Well time slips away and leaves you with nothing, mister, but
Boring stories of

Glory days, well they'll pass you by

I can feel you there
Thinking of a reason, well, it's really not very hard
To love you even though you nearly lost my heart
How can I explain the meaning of our love
It fits so tight, closer than a glove
Sitting on a pebble by the river playing guitar
Wond'ring if we're really ever gonna get that far
Do you know there's something wrong
'Cause I've felt it all along

I can see your face in the mirrors of my mind
Will you still be there?
We're really not so clever as we seem to think we are
We've always got our troubles so we solve them in the bar
As the days go by, we seem to drift apart
If I could only find a way to keep hold of your heart

Sitting on a pebble by the river playing guitar
Wond'ring if we're really ever gonna get that far
Do you know there's something wrong
'Cause I've felt it all along

Sitting in the valley as I watch the sun go down
I can see you there
Thinking of a reason, well, it's really not very hard
To love you even though you nearly lost my heart
When will we know when the change is gonna come
I've got a good feeling and it's coming from the sun

Sitting on a pebble by the river playing guitar
Wond'ring if we're really ever gonna get that far
Do you know there's something wrong
We'll stick together 'cause we're strong"

Did they steal you away like a thief in the night?
Love like this must take flight
Why don't they play what they played
On the nights you danced with me?

Went down to see my V.A. man
He said ""Son, don't you understand""

I had a brother at Khe Sanh fighting off the Viet Cong
They're still there, he's all gone
He had a woman he loved in Saigon
I got a picture of him in her arms now

2095,95,Fortress Around Your Heart,Sting,1985,fortress around your heart,sting, NA ,1.0,1,"Under the ruins of a walled city
Crumbling towers and beams of yellow light
No flags of truce, no cries of pity
The siege guns had been pounding all through the night
It took a day to build the city
We walked through its streets in the afternoon
As I returned across the fields I'd known
I recognized the walls where I'd once laid
I had to stop in my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid

And if I built this fortress around your heart
Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire
Then let me build a bridge
For I cannot fill the chasm
And let me set the battlements on fire

Then I went off to fight some battle
That I'd invented inside my head
Away so long for years and years
You probably thought or even wished that I was dead
While the armies are all sleeping
Beneath the tattered flag we'd made
I had to stop in my track for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid


This prison has now become your home
A sentence you seem prepared to pay
It took a day to build the city
We walked through its streets in the afternoon
As I returned across the lands I'd known
I recognized the fields where I'd once played
I had to stop in my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid"

I've been kicked so many times
I don't know nothin' else
Still I noticed your urgency
And recognized the flair
That ya got from chasin'
All those east coast dares
And I've seen it before
It happens time and again
All cut up inside
Yet you're caught in a spin
Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Take a good hard look
There ain't nothin' ever new
Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Will you ever find out
Guess I'll leave it up to you
Saw you dancin' out at Madame Wong Two's
You did the same two steps
That I taught you back in June
Heard you dined last night
At Conte Razor's Café
Did you get your fill
Did you think you had to pay
Still I noticed your urgency
And recognized the pain
And I'm sure it's the same
You feel again and again
And I wish I could get us
That second chance

You've got someone there to say
I'll show you

Can we ever change our minds?

That you don't care


I've got to gather my senses together
I've been through worse kinds of weather

Now we're up to talking divorce
And we weren't even married
On my own
Once again now
One more time
By myself
No one said it was easy
But it once was so easy
Well I believed in love
Now here I stand
I wonder why
I'm on my own
Why did it end this way
On my own
This wasn't how it was supposed to be
On my own
I wish that we could do it all again
So many times
I know I should have told you
Losing you it cut like a knife
You walked out and there went my life
I don't want to live without you
On my own
On my own
On my own
Chorus Repeat
This wasn't how it was supposed to end
I wish that we could do it all again
I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone
On my own, I've got to find where I belong again
I've got to learn how to be strong again
I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone
By myself by myself
I've got to find out what was mine again
My heart is saying that it's my time again
And I have faith that I will shine again
I have faith in me

Though his body says stop his spirit cries - never!

It's the paradox that drives us on
It's a battle of wills
In the heat of attack it's the passion that kills
The victory is yours alone

Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

And if, by chance, that special place
That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place
Find your strength in love"

The two of us together
Taking this crazy chance
To be all alone
We both know that
We should not be together
Cause if we're found out
It could mess up both our happy homes
I hate to think about us
All meeting up together
Cause soon as I
Looked at you
It would show on my face
Then they'll know that
We've been loving each other
They can never know
No, no, no
We can't leave a trace
Sitting at home
I do nothing all day
But think about you
And hope that you're okay
Hoping you'll call
Before anyone gets home
I'll wait anxiously
Alone by the phone
How could something so wrong
Be so right?
I wish we didn't have to
Keep our love out of sight, yeah
Living two lives
Just ain't easy at all
But we gotta hang on in there
Or fall
Secret lovers, yeah
That's what we are
Trying so hard to hide the way we feel
Because we both belong to someone else
But we can't let it go
Cause what we feel
Is, oh, so real
So real, so real
You and me
Are we fair?
Is this cruel
Or do we care?
Can they tell
What's in our minds
Maybe they've had secret loves
All of the time
In the middle of making love
We notice the time
We both get nervous
Cause it's way after 9:00
Even though we hate it
We know it's time that we go
We gotta be careful
So that no one will know
Secret lovers, yeah
That's what we are
We shouldn't be together
But we can't let it go
Cause what we feel
Is, oh, so real
So real, so real
So real, so real"

Rhapsody plays, a melody for you and me
Until the moment that you give your love to me

Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above

Look inside your heart, I'll look inside mine

In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?
Worlds are turning, and we're just hanging on
Facing our fear and standing out there alone
A yearning and it's real to me
There must be someone who's feeling for me

In time you slipped away
When the mirror crashed I called you

Crackin' my drugs, back against the wall, overdosin'

And you know (?) when the going gets tough, the tough gets goin'
All of a sudden, half these niggas candy canin'
And sugarcoating the money they're makin' in the hood for roles
Caught up in the moment, never even touched a ho
Got 'em on the mild drugs longer then you fuckin notice
I know some youngins quick to up it that's ready to blow
And we don’t play no homegirls, real homephobic

Abbreviate, my appreciation is a token
Laughing all the way to the bank, no lackin' or loafin'
Keep a couple addicts to get a new packet of dope in
Taxin 'em 4 bands, slap 'em with no hands
Hand to hand, handin' samples out – that’s free promotion

Sprinkle it in my weed ‘cause I was way too scared to use it

And leave my nigga cop the Cola, the soda and yola lockin up
Today I slip my feet in new sneakers like Mr. Rogers biiitch
Hold me down, the poster child for pyrex visual

Save some light for me
Figures up ahead
Moving in the trees
White skin in linen
Perfume on my wrist
And the full moon that hangs over
These dreams in the mist
Darkness on the edge
Shadows where I stand
I search for the time
On a watch with no hands
I want to see you clearly
Come closer than this
But all I remember
Are the dreams in the mist
These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away
Is it cloak 'n dagger
Could it be spring or fall
I walk without a cut
Through a stained glass wall
Weaker in my eyesight
The candle in my grip
And words that have no form
Are falling from my lips
These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away
There's something out there
I can't resist
I need to hide away from the pain
There's something out there
I can't resist
The sweetest song is silence
That I've ever heard
Funny how your feet
In dreams never touch the earth
In a wood full of princes
Freedom is a kiss
But the prince hides his face
From dreams in the mist
These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away
These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away"

How would they hear the beating of my heart?
Will it grow cold, the secret that I hide? Will I grow old?
How will they hear? When will they learn? How will they know?

Carved out of caring, fashioned by fate
Could suffer so hard
From the games played once too often?
But making mistakes
Is a part of life's imperfections
Born of the years
Is it so wrong to be human after all?

Drawn into the stream
Of undefined illusion
Those diamond dreams
They can't disguise the truth

That there is something about you
Baby so right
I wouldn't be without you baby tonight

If ever our love was concealed
No one can say that we didn't feel
A million things
And a perfect dream of life
Gone, fragile but free
We remain tender together
If not so in love
It's not so wrong
We're only human after all

These changing years
They add to your confusion
Oh and you need to hear
The time that told the truth

Because there's something about you
Baby so right
I couldn't be without you
Baby tonight
I know there's something about you
Baby
And I couldn't live without you

A rumor could spread so fast
'Cause now the word is out
All over town
That I'm longing for you


Maybe I was the one who left the trace
Was there a message written on my face?
One little emotion so easily read
That you would know my love
Before a word was said

Was it my eyes
That let you know you had control?
Because the way you move
It was so self-assured
You knew I would surrender

You can talk to me
T-t-talk to me
Though we lay face to face
And cheek to cheek
Our voices stray
From common ground where they could meet
The walls run high
To veil a swelling tear
(Tear, tear, tear)
Let the walls burn down
Set your secret free
You can break their bounds
'Cause you're safe with me
You can lose your doubt
'Cause you'll find no danger here
You can talk to me

Inside I'm slowly dying

All I needed was a simple hello
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear my cry

Never wanted to see things your way, I had to go astray
Oh, why was I such a fool?
Now I see that the grass is greener, is it too late for me
To find my way home? How could I be so wrong?
Leaving me all alone

Don't you know the hurt will cause an inferno
Romance up in flames, why should I take the blame?
You were the one who left me neglected (I'm so sorry)
Apology not accepted, add me to the broken hearts you've collected

We got spaceships made from glass, we look up as they pass
We get a good look at Wonder Woman's ass
While we sit there, she scrape the froth off my beer
While you’re at it, why don't you take your wig off dear?
Yeah - this is some James Brown ""Living in America"" shit
And probably as good as it's ever gon’ get
At the campsite, under a lamp light, Hamites and whites
Survivalists types obsessed with plant life
The Israelites say they plan to stand and fight
To do that, first you gotta recognize what's right
Happy wife, happy life, she a happy mutant, maybe you're right
She's the professor Xavier type
She doesn't strike you as the type that likes the lyrics I write
We spend cold icicle nights, communicate Skype
After work go home, lay pipe, then play fight
Explain life, talk about what our day was like
I got a blow torch for bubbles and candlestick market trouble
Whatever man, I was born to hustle
Read the charts, enjoy the warm breeze and fart
Been there, done that, I don't need to talk
Cause I'm a swasta sipping vodka, eating tandoori steak 'n lobster
Harrison Ford used to be a carpenter

Three’s Company: Suzanne Somers, Mr. Furley, remember?
Put the shower curtain up was clever
Love is love, knuckles and nubs, billy club thugs with a grudge
Against men with man buns and guns
Poker run emerald coast, I’m stoked - that's an inside joke
Propose a toast on wide approach
Black shoes, white gloves, bowties, slick quotes and cigar smoke
Now customs wanna’ check my cargo
They gotta' Hip-Hop embargo
I visit Mar-a-Lago, to see if martial law is normal
Eagle point marina, party on the slip
Polly want a cracker, shorty wanna' strip
Rip, this is some James Brown ""Living in a America"" shit
The Cherubims win, the Seraphims quit
High speed trains constructed by low speed cranes
Asteroid strike, it's all in vain"

Hung up on the line

And hide out in the cellar
By now the fighting will be close at hand
Don't believe the church and state
And everything they tell you
Believe in me, I'm with the high command
Can you hear me, can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?
Can you hear me, can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?
There's a gun and ammunition
Just inside the doorway
Use it only in emergency
Better you should pray to God
The Father and the Spirit
Will guide you and protect from up here
Can you hear me, can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?
Can you hear me, can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?
Swear allegiance to the flag
Whatever flag they offer
Never hint at what you really feel
Teach the children quietly
For some day sons and daughters
Will rise up and fight while we stood still
Can you hear me, can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?
Can you hear me, can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?
Can you hear me running (can you hear me calling you?)
(Can you hear me) hear me calling you?

They’re started by the jealous people
And they get mad
Seeing something they had
And somebody else is holding
They tell me that temptation is very hard to resist
But these wicked women
Ooh, they just persist
Maybe you think it’s cute
But girl, I’m not impressed
I tell you one time only with my business
Please don’t mess
Look at all these rumors
Surrounding me every day
I just need some time
Some time to get away from
From all these rumors
I can’t take it no more
My best friend said there’s one out now
About me and the girl next door
Hear the one about Tina
Some say she’s much too loose
That came straight from a guy
Who claims he’s tasted her juice
Did you hear the one about Michael
Some say he must be gay
I tried to argue, but they said
If he was straight he wouldn’t move that way
Did you hear that one about Susan, some say she’s just a tease
In a camisole, she’s six feet tall, she’ll knock you to your knees
Look at all these rumors
Surrounding me every day
I just need some time
Some time to get away from
From all these rumors
I can’t take it no more
My best friend said there’s one out now
About me and the girl next door
I can’t go no place without somebody pointing a finger
I can’t show my face cause when it comes to rumors
I’m a dead ringer
It seems from rumors I just can’t get away
I bet there’ll even be rumors floating around on Judgment Day
I’ll think I’ll write my congressman
And tell him to pass a bill
For the next time they catch somebody startin’ rumors
Shoot to kill
Look at all these rumors
Surrounding me every day
I just need some time
Some time to get away from
From all these rumors
I can’t take it no more
My best friend said there’s one out now
About me and the girl next door
What’s mine is mine
I ain’t got time for rumors in my life

Not a man who drinks
So please let me live my life

If only you would stay
There's so many games we'd play
Why should we pretend
To be just friends
When we could be so much more?

Baby love
(You are my)
Baby love
(Just call it)
Baby love
(You are my)
Baby love
(Just call it)

Words
Don't mean so much to me
I'd rather wait and see
See what happens
When the lights go down
With your arms around me
Time
To leave the world behind
Save it for another time
'Cause I don't remember
Where I am
When you start to love me (love me)


Oooh, oooh, oooh
Baby
Baby love
Oooh, oooh ooh
Sweet and tasty
Baby
Baby love
Oooh, oooh, ooh

Boy
I want you by my side
There's no reason we should hide
How we feel
When we are near each other
Undercover
Warm
I hold you close to me
You're perfection
First degree
'Cause I don't remember
Where I am
When you start to move me (move me)"

She's moody and grey
She's mean and she's restless
So restless, so restless indeed
All over you as they say
Rumours or rivals yell at the strike force

Are you aware you're being illegal?
It's making your savior behaviour look evil
'Scuse my timing but say
How'd you fit in with this flim, flam and judy

I pull my shirt off and pray
We're sacred and bound to suffer the heatwave

Cut open murmurs and sounds be calm hands on skin
Carry further, entangled strands all sing
I'm saving some time to slip away
We could dance!
Shouldn't be asking, wild and scheming
Could be my election day

Just look towards the west and find a friend

And we talk 'til my daddy say
Said you ain't seen nothing, 'til you're down on a muffin
And there's sure to be a change in ways
Now there's a cheerleader, that's a real big breeder
As far as I can reminisce
But the best thing of loving, was her sister and her cousin
And it started with a little kiss, like this!

See-saw swinging, with the boys in school
And her feet are just fly up in the air
Singing, ""Hey diddle diddle with a kitty in the middle""
And they swinging like it just didn't care
So I took a big chance, at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
It wasn't me, she was foolin' 'cause she knew what was she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way!
She told me to

Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way (She told me to)
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way
Well just gimme a kiss
Ooh, like this!

School girl sleazy with a classy kind of sassy
Little skirt climbing way up her knee
It was three young ladies, in the school gym locker
And they find they were looking at D
I was high school loser, never made it with a lady
'Til a boy told me something I missed
That my next door neighbor, had a daughter had a favor
So I gave the girl a little kiss, like this

See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
With her feet flying up in the air
Singing, ""Hey diddle diddle, with a kitty in the middle""
I was swinging like I didn't care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin' when she knew what she was doin'

Only money makes
The world go round
But all the gold
Won't heal your soul
If your world should
Tumble to the ground
You say you hunger
For something you can't get at all
And love is not enough anymore
So listen
Love is all
Love is all
Love is all we need
Love is all
Love is all
Love is all we need, yeah
Love is all
Love is all
Love is all we need, yeah
Love is all
Love is all
Love is all we need, yeah
If I was King for just one day
I would give it all away
I would give it all away to be with you
If I was King for just one day
I have just one thing to say
You know that love is
All we need to get us through
If I was King for just one day
I would give it all away
I would give it all away to be with you
If I was King for just one day
Just one thing to say
Love"

Oh, and tell me when
When will we ever learn?
There's nowhere else we can turn
The truth is in our hearts
Here we are together

Sometimes the road gets hard to travel
Sometimes the pain's too much to bear
Sometimes when life seems to unravel
That's the time oh to say
We're going to make it anyway
Can't you see that?

Out here, me and you
Reaching out to each other
Is all that we can do
Here we stand trying not to fall
There's no need (There's no need to worry)
Love will conquer all

I'd say love would keep us from pain
Had I been there, had I been there
I would promise you all of my life
But to lose you would cut like a knife
So I don't dare, no I don't dare
Cause I've never come close in all of these years
You are the only one to stop my tears
And I'm so scared, I'm so scared

Take me back in time maybe I can forget
Turn a different corner and we never would have met
Would you care
I don't understand it, for you it's a breeze
Little by little you've brought me to my knees
Don't you care
No I've never come close in all of these years
You are the only one to stop my tears
I'm so scared of this love
And if all that there is, is this fear of being used
I should go back to being lonely and confused
If I could, I would, I swear"

But her heart kept cheering her on
She had a real good man, steady job
But the two of them just weren't in her heart

To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying, ""Girl you're wrong, go home""

Long days, short nights when you're on the road
For a pretty girl it's a heavy load
And even so, who'll pay your fare?
She said I'll make it on a wing and a prayer

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying, ""Girl, you're wrong, go home""

She said I've on right to tell her how life should be
Especially when the only one she ever cared about in life was me
But she agreed to go along with my final word

As fate would have life come around
My world started tumbling down
I lost my family, my friends and job
And set free the only one who stuck with me from the start

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying, ""Girl, you're wrong, go home""

And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away

And when the night falls
Loneliness calls

Oh! I want to dance with somebody

Oh! I want to dance with somebody
I want to feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I want to dance with somebody

I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

Oh! I want to dance with somebody
I want to feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I want to dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh! I want to dance with somebody
I want to feel the heat
Yeah! I want to dance with somebody

Somebody who loves me
Somebody who, somebody who
To hold me in his arms

On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

And so we're

Running just as fast as we can
Holding on to one another's hand
Trying to get away into the night
And then you put your arms around me
And we tumble to the ground
And then you say

I think we're alone now
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now
The beating of our hearts is the only sound

Look at the way
We gotta hide what we're doing
Cause what would they say
If they ever knew
And so we're

Running just as fast as we can
Holding on to one another's hand

When you're standing before me
With tears in your eyes
Trying to tell me that you have found you another
And you just don't love me no more
What did you think I would say at this moment
When I'm faced with the knowledge
That you just don't love me
Did you think I would curse you
Or say things to hurt you
'cause you just don't love me no more
Did you think I could hate you
Or raise my hands to you
Now come on you know me too well
How could I hurt you when darling I love you
And you know I'd never hurt you-oo-wo-oo-o-o-o...
What do you think I would give at this moment
If you'd stay I'd subtract twenty years from my life
I'd fall down on my knees
And kiss the ground that you walk on
If I could just hold you again
I'd fall down on my knees
And kiss the ground that you walk on baby
If I could just hold you { pause }
If I, could just hold you { pause }
If I.........

I've never seen you shine so bright
You were amazing
I've never seen so many people want to be there by your side
And when you turned to me and smiled
It took my breath away
And I have never had such a feeling
Such a feeling of complete and utter love
As I do tonight

The world of me and you?

You never let it end

Well I wonder if it's wise
To hold you

Be the one who breathes life in this heart of mine
Next time I fall in love
I'll know better what to do
Next time I fall in love
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo

The next time I fall in love

Next time I'm gonna follow through
And if it drives me crazy
I will know better why
The next time I try
Next time I fall in love
I'll know better what to do
Next time I fall in love
Ooo ooo ooo

The next time I fall in love

I keep looking for something I can't get
Broken hearts lie all around me
And I don't see an easy way to get out of this
Her diary, it sits by the bedside table
The curtains are closed, the cats in the cradle
Who would've thought that a boy like me could come to this

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away, I should've walked away

Is there any just cause for feeling like this?
On the surface, I'm a name on a list
I try to be discreet, but then blow it again
I've lost and found, it's my final mistake
She's loving by proxy, no give and all take
Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away, I should've walked away
It was a long hot night
She made it easy, she made it feel right
But now it's over the moment has gone
I followed my hands not my head, I know I was wrong
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss

The shadow of a lover goes dancing by
Looking for a little bit of love to grow, so
Give me love, give me heart and soul
You never let me cross to the other side now
I'm tied to the hope that you will somehow
Hard on the heels of something more
But I lost your love, heart and soul
The tear in my heart as you walk on by (more than an ocean)
I feel so low and your head is high
Everything you do convinces me more, please (keeps us apart)
Give me love, give me heart and soul
Looking to the day when I saw your face (I feel a tearing in half of my heart)
I wasn't in the running, I wasn't in the race
You move in a way that I've known before
Now I want your love, heart and soul
Leaving you ain't easy now (Tired eyes, tears that dried)
Loving you's the harder part (On the bed, on the pillow, where the love has died)
You never want me for myself (A turn of the key, through the door you go)
Now I've needed you right from the very start (Don't look back, to hurt me more )
(Everything you said was to the point)
Oh won't you even try to (Can't you try to)

And don't you make me beg for more (must I beg you)
Give a sign, I need to know
A little bit of heart and soul
Walking on the water, walking on the air (a walk on the water)
That was the heart of the love we shared
Do you keep secret left untold (is all that I need)
Can't give love, heart or soul
I used to have a lover with a Midas touch (but miracles are not happening)
I turned to gold but he turned to dust
Left me for another, I turned to stone
Now give me love, heart and soul
Living in a fantasy (Tired eyes, tears that dried)
There's never any room to breathe (On the bed, on the pillow, where you told your lies)
Hoping every waking hour (A turn of the key, my blood runs cold)
You'll turn around and say that we can start (Don't look back to hurt me more)
(Everything you did just said it all)
Oh won't you even try to (Can't you try to)

Give a little bit of heart and soul (give a little bit of heart and soul)
And don't you make me beg for more (must I beg you)
Give a sign, I need to know
A little bit of heart and soul
Somehow, I lost my way
Looking to see something in your eyes
But love will never compromise
Now this is the politics of life, yeah!
Give a little bit of heart and soul (give a little bit of heart and soul)
Give a little bit of love to grow
Give a little bit of heart and soul (give a little bit of heart and soul)
And don't you make me beg for more (must I beg you)

They're burning into the night

Making too many problems

To make it a place worth living in

Ooh, Superman, where are you now?
When everything's gone wrong somehow
The men of steel, the men of power
Are losing control by the hour

Ooh, when the sun was shining
Yes and the stars were bright all through the night
And the sound of your laughter as I held you tight
So long ago...

I won't be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
We're not just making promises
That we know we'll never keep

When we get to know each other
And we're both feeling much stronger
Then let's try to talk it over
Let's wait awhile longer

Let's wait awhile
Before it's too late
Let's wait awhile
Before we go too far

Remember that special night?
When all of the stars were shining bright
We made our first endeavor
To stay together

We made our very first promise
To love, to share
And be real honest
But on that very first night
It wasn't quite right

Let's wait awhile
Before it's too late
Let's wait awhile
Our love will be great
Let's wait awhile
Before we go too far

I didn't really know not to let all my feelings show
To save some for later so our love will be greater

You said you would always love me
Remember I said the same thing too
You don't have to be frightened with my love
Because I'll never give up on you

Let's wait awhile
Before it's too late
You know you can't rush love
Love
Let's wait awhile (Ooh, ooh)
Before it's too late
Let's wait awhile (Wait awhile)
Our love will be great
Let's wait awhile
Before we go too far (Far, far, oh)
Let's wait awhile (Let's just take our time)
Before it's too late
Let's wait awhile (Love's so good)
Sure our love will be there
Let's wait awhile (Slow it down)
Before we go too far

I promise
I'll be worth the wait"

ALLEN: Um, they're okay.
BATEMAN: Their early work was a little too new wave for my taste. But when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor.
ALLEN: Hey, Halberstram?
BATEMAN: Yes, Allen?
ALLEN: Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you... Do you have a dog? A little chow or something?
BATEMAN: No, Allen.
ALLEN: Is that a raincoat?
BATEMAN: Yes, it is. In '87, Huey released this; Fore!, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is ""Hip To Be Square"". A song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends. It's also a personal statement about the band itself. Hey, Paul!
Bateman murders Allen with an axe
BATEMAN: Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now, you fuckin' stupid bastard!"

Put your hand in mine now and forever
Darling here I stand, stand before you now
Deep inside I always knew
It was you, you and me
Two hearts drawn together bound by destiny
It was you and you for me
Every road leads to your door
Every step I take forever more

Just say you'll love me for the rest of your life
I got a lot of love and I don't want to let go
Will you still love me for the rest of my life?
Because I can't go on
No, I can't go on
I can't go on
If I'm on my own

Take me as I am
Put your heart in mine, stay with me forever
Because I am just a man who never understood
I never had a thing to prove
There was you
You and me
Then it all came clear so suddenly
How close to you that I wanna be

Just say you'll love me for the rest of your life
I got a lot of love and I don't want to let go
Will you still love me for the rest of my life?
Because I can't go on
No, I can't go on
I can't go on
If I'm on my own

Do you believe a love could run so strong?
Do you believe a love could pass you by?
There was no special one for me
I was the lonely one, you see
But then my heart lost all control
Now you're all that I know

Just say you'll love me for the rest of your life
I got a lot of love and I don't want to let go
Will you still love me for the rest of my life?
Because I can't go on (Can't go on)
No, I can't go on
Because I can't go on (Will you still love me?)
No, I can't go on (Just say you love me)
I can't go on without somebody I can count on
Because I can't go on (Will you still love me?)
No, I can't go on (Just say you love me)

On a mountain, by a fountain
Flowers blooming everywhere
With Venus and with cupid
The picture's very clear

Hang the sign upon the door, say, 'Don't disturb this groove'
Just a way to say that, I'm so into you
And the feeling's so real, so don't disturb this groove

Erotic whispers for the listener
Let the music fill the air
Excuse me for a moment
I'm at a loss for words
By election, sheer perfection
And as if these eyes would care
Your heart is in the right place
So don't you go and change
Baby over and over
The passion starts again
You're my lollipops and everything
And a little taste of sin
Causing fire and desire
In this mortal soul to live
'Til the angels fall from Heaven
And the day the earth stands still

Hang the sign upon the door, say, 'Don't disturb this groove'
Just a way to say that, I'm so into you
And the feeling's so real, so don't disturb this groove

When it feels so real, don't disturb this groove

Close your eyes and let the music put you in the mood
Can you feel it? (Uh huh)
Baby, just lock the door and turn the phone off
This time, it's time for me and you
Are you ready? (Yes)

Hang the sign upon the door, say, 'Don't disturb this groove'

Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears, and sting my eyes

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta, you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Feels like in I'm a race, but I already won first place
I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did
You got me thinking 'bout our life, our house, and kids, yeah
Every morning, I look at you and smile
'Cause boy, you came around and you knocked me down, knocked me down

Sometimes love comes around, and it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around, and it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down

I never thought I'd hear myself say
""Y'all go ahead, I think I'm gonna kick it with my girl today""
I used to be commander-in-chief of my pimp ship flying high
Til I met this pretty little missile that shot me out the sky
Hey, so now I'm crashing
Don't know how it happened
But I know it feels so damn good
Said if I could go back and make it happen faster
Don't you know I would, baby, if I could?
Miss Independent, to the fullest
The load never too much, she helping me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life
I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight
Girl, sometimes love...

Sometimes love comes around, and it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around, and it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down

Tell me now, can you make it past your Caspers?
So we can finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dream
That seem to only date the head of football teams
And I was the class clown that always kept you laughing
We were never meant to be, baby, we just happened
So please don't mess up the trick
Hey Young World, I'm the new Slick Rick
They say I move too quick but we can't let this moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess ask someone that's only average?
For advice, OMG, you listen to that bitch
Woe is me, baby, this is tragic
'Cause we had it, we was magic
I was flying now I'm crashing
This is Bad, real bad, Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad, Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'm gon' ask him

So you gotta take the good with the bad, happy and the sad
And let it bring a better future than I had in the past
Oh, 'cause I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again (Whoa, whoa)
I'll admit it, I was scared to act to love's call (Whoa, whoa)
And if it hits better, make it worth the fall

Sometimes love comes around, and it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around, and it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down

Won't see it coming when it happens
But when it happens
You're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
You see when love comes and knocks you down
Yeah
Won't see it coming when it happens
But when it happens
You're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
You see when love comes and knocks you down
Yeah"

In France a skinny man
Died of a big disease with a little name
By chance his girlfriend came across a needle
And soon she did the same
At home there are seventeen-year-old boys
And their idea of fun
Is being in a gang called The Disciples
High on crack, totin' a machine gun
Time, time

Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling of a church
And killed everyone inside
You turn on the telly and every other story
Is tellin' you somebody died
Sister killed her baby 'cuz she couldn't afford to feed it
And we're sending people to the moon
In September my cousin tried reefer for the very first time
Now he's doing horse, it's June
Times, times

It's silly, no?
When a rocket ship explodes
And everybody still wants to fly
Some say a man ain't happy
Unless a man truly dies
Oh, why?
Time, time

Baby make a speech, Star Wars fly
Neighbors just shine it on
But if a night falls and a bomb falls
Will anybody see the dawn
Time, times

It's silly, no?
When a rocket blows up
And everybody still wants to fly
Some say a man ain't happy, truly
Until a man truly dies
Oh, why?
Oh, why?

Hurry before it's too late
Let's fall in love, get married, have a baby
We'll call him Nate... if it's a boy

You like music that much then start fucking listening to it
Deep down, I bought the sweater
Used it as cocaine pyjamas
What a waste of dough
Pulling it out when I'm on the snow
Fucking waste, didn't feel right as a daytime top
Felt like I was try to be trendy when I'm not
So when I got in and I was off me bollocks, mates are like ""Fuck, even his pyjamas are proper.""

Lovers through thick and thin
Lives touched with real emotion
Faithful till the bitter end
Now I must admit that the story's attractive
I've lost in far too many affairs
I've seen all the pain that the morning can bring
I need to prove to myself
This is more than a crush
Can you convince me
It's not just a physical rush
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this the love that's been keepin' me up all night
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love
So many nights in blind confusion
I've walked the line of love
We reach out in disillusion
When one night isn't nearly enough
Now I'd like to know that for once in my life
I'm sure of what tomorrow may bring
I've heard all your talk
Can I take it to heart
Now look me straight in the eye
'Cause tonight is the night
We've got to ask each other
If the moment is right
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this the love that's been keepin' me up all night
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love
I've tread those mean streets
Blind alleys where the currency of love changes hands
All touch, no feeling
Just another one night stand
I need to know that there's someone who cares
Could you be the angel to answer my prayers
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this the love that's been keepin' me up all night
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this the love that's been keepin' me up all night
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love
Is this love"

Where one man's nightmare is another man's dream
Pull the covers up high and pray for the mornin' light
Better leave it alone in the heat of the night
Met a man with a message from the other side
Couldn't take the pressure - had to leave it behind
He said it's up to you
You can run or you can fight - (ya that's right)
Better leave it alone in the heat of the night
In the heat of the night they'll be comin' around
They'll be lookin' for answers they'll be chasin' you down
In the heat of the night
(Where you gonna hide when it all comes down)
(Don't look back don't ever turn around)
Had to pay the piper to call the tune
Said he'd be back someday - said he'd be back real soon
Pull the shades down low - you'll know when the time is right
When you're lyin' alone in the heat of the night"

What are those words whispered, baby
Just as you turn away

Out on the edge of town
I wanna read your mind
To know just what I've got in this new thing I've found

So tell me what I see
When I look in your eyes
Is that you baby
Or just a brilliant disguise?

I heard somebody call your name
From underneath our willow
I saw something tucked in shame
Underneath your pillow
Well I've tried so hard, baby
But I just can't see
What a woman like you
Is doing with me

So tell me who I see
When I look in your eyes
Is that you, baby
Or just a brilliant disguise?

Now look at me, baby
Struggling to do everything right
And then it all falls apart
When out go the lights
I'm just a lonely pilgrim
I walk this world in wealth
I want to know if it's you I don't trust
'Cause I damn sure don't trust myself

Now you play the loving woman
I'll play the faithful man
But just don't look too close
Into the palm of my hand
We stood at the alter
The gypsy swore our future was right
But come the wee wee hours
Well maybe, baby, the gypsy lied

So when you look at me
You better look hard and look twice
Is that me, baby
Or just a brilliant disguise?

Tonight our bed is cold
I'm lost in the darkness of our love
God, have mercy on the man
Who doubts what he's sure of"

I want you to be mine

I know you think I'm not
Your picture perfect jewel
Who'll never break apart
When everything was cool
I needed to explore
And open up the door
But now I need you more
Im sending out a message
A message so sincere
When I close my eyes
I need to feel you near
Can't get you off my mind
For leaving me this time
I'm still in love with you


If I had your attention
I'd tell you what I learned
Despite of good intentions
Its easy to get burned
I learned my lesson well
It's you I need to tell
This time Im all for you
I need for you to trust me
To give me all your best
I'll prove just what your love means
Just put me to the test
This time I need to stay
Don't need to go away
I'm still in love with you


You're my morning sun
You're my shining star
You're my number one
Cross my broken heart
In your eyes
I see
What you mean to me
You're my destiny

Cross my broken heart, boy
Cross my broken heart for you
I'm going to stay this time"

Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everythin' was as fresh as the bright blue sky (Sky)
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
An' if I'd stare too long, I'd probably break down and cry

Woah-oh-oh! Sweet child of mine
Woah, oh-oh-oh! Sweet love of mine


She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
An' pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

Woah-oh-oh! Sweet child of mine
Ooh, oh-oh-oh! Sweet love of mine


Oh yeah! Woah-oh-oh-oh! Sweet child of mine

But if you don't
Just let me go
'Cause teacher
There are things that I don't want to learn
And the last one I had
Made me cry
So I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
When you were just a stranger
And I was at your feet
I didn't feel the danger
Now I feel the heat
That look in your eyes
Telling me ""No""
So you think that you love me
Know that you need me
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong
Just let me go
(Chorus)
So when you say that you need me
That you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong
Let me go
And teacher
There are things that I still have to learn
But the one thing I have is my pride
Oh, so I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because there ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Who just isn't willin' to try
I'm so cold inside
Maybe just one more try"

Though you're not here
Since you said we're through
It seems like years
Time keeps dragging on and on
And forever's been and gone
Still I can't figure what went wrong
I'd still do anything for you
I'll play your game
You hurt me through and through
But you can have your way
I can pretend each time I see you
That I don't care and I don't need you
And though you'll never see me crying
You know inside I feel like dying
And I'd do anything for you
In spite of it all
I've learned so much from you
You made me strong
But don't you ever think that I don't love you
That for one minute I forgot you
But sometimes things don't work out right
And you just have to say goodbye
I hope you find someone to please you
Someone who'll care and never leave you
But if that someone ever hurts you
You just might need a friend to turn to
And I'd do anything for you
I'll give you up
If that's what I should do
To make you happy
I can pretend each time I see you
That I don't care and I don't need you
And though inside I feel like dying
You know you'll never see me crying
Don't you ever think that I don't love you
That for one minute I forgot you
But sometimes things don't work out right
And you just have to say goodbye"

I can't stop the feeling I've been this way before

I can feel my love for you growing stronger day by day

So I can hold you in my arms

Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know

It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be

Could not erase the beauty of your face
Just for awhile
Won't you let me shelter you

Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
I wish that I could give you
Something more
That I could be yours

How do we explain
Something that took us by surprise
Promises in vain
Love that is real
But in disguise
What happens now
Do we break another rule?
Let our lovers play the fool?
I don't know how
To stop feeling this way

Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
If only I could give you more

Well, I think that I've been true
To everybody else but me
And the way I feel about you
Makes my heart long to be free
Every time I look into your eyes
I'm helplessly aware
That the someone I've been searching for
Is right there

Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
I wish that I could give you more
That I can be yours"

To be bold and naked at your side
Sometimes I think that you'll never understand me
Maybe this time is forever, say it can be, whoa
That's all you wanted
Somethin' special, someone sacred in your life
Just for one moment, to be warm and naked at my side
Sometimes I think that you'll never understand me
But somethin' tells me together, we'd be happy, whoa baby
I will be your father figure
Put your tiny hand in mine
I will be your preacher teacher
Anything you have in mind
I will be your father figure
I have had enough of crime
I will be the one who loves you
'Til the end of time
That's all I wanted
But sometimes love can be mistaken for a crime
That's all I wanted
Just to see my baby's blue eyes shine
This time I think that my lover understands me
If we have faith in each other then we can be strong
(Chorus)
If you are the desert, I'll be the sea
If you ever hunger, hunger for me
Whatever you ask for, that's what I'll be
So when you remember the ones who have lied
Who said that they cared but then
Laughed as you cried
Beautiful darling, don't think of me
Because all I ever wanted
It's in your eyes baby (baby)
And love can't lie, no
Greet me with the eyes of a child
My love is always tellin' me so
Heaven is a kiss and a smile
Just hold on, hold on
I won't let you go, my baby
(Chorus)
I will be your father (I will be your)
I will be your (father) preacher teacher
I will be your (I'll be your daddy, oh)
I will be the one who loves you

Just maybe
Naughty girls need love too

I've been told time and time again
That you can't treat love like a game
But I play rough
With hearts that never mend
'Cause some guys like you do the same
Love
Was just a four letter word
Never heard
How absurd
How it could be
But now
I can't believe this is real
How I feel now you steal
My heart away from me
Used to be so good and so bad
Sex was just something I had
Used to always know what to do
Now you've got me confused

Baby, don't let me be misunderstood
Temporary love's so bad
But it feels so good
Then along came you
Now I know it's true
Naughty girls need love too
Then came you
Then came you

Yes, it's true
I'm in love with you
And believe it, baby
This time your love won't get away
Stay here in the place to be
We can get busy my way
For six forevers and a day
Ooh, it's only you I adore
So much more
Than my body was asking for
Yes
Your love is breaking my chill
Even still there's a thrill in my heart

Samantha Fox was such a wild dame
Huh
But what's in a name?
(S-S-Samantha, S-S-Samantha Fox)
No more fun and games of the mind
Let's get busy one time

So moving like you're forty
This groove is much too naughty
Can't you see
I want you just for me
Boys, make some noise

Girl, I want to shower you with diamonds
And please don't tease
If you lie my heart will freeze
Freeze, freeze, freeze
Don't let me, baby
Temporary love's so bad
Temporary love's so bad
Then along came you

Don't, don't

When you make love, do you look in the mirror?
Who do you think of, does he look like me?
Do you tell lies? And say that it's forever
Do you think twice, or just touch and see?
Ooh, babe
Oh, yeah
When you're alone, do you let go?
Are you wild and willing or is it just for show?
Ooh, come on

I don't want to touch you too much, baby
'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
I know you think that love is the way you make it
So I don't want to be there when you decide to break it
No

Love bites, love bleeds
It's bringing me to my knees
Love lives, love dies
It's no surprise
Love begs, love pleads
It's what I need

When I'm with you, are you somewhere else?
Am I getting through or do you please yourself?
When you wake up, will you walk out?
It can't be love if you throw it about
Ooh, babe

I don't want to touch you too much, baby
'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
Oh

Love bites, love bleeds

All at once I looked and you were gone
And now you're looking back at me
Searching for a way that we can be like we were before
Now I'm back to what I knew before you
Somehow the city doesn't look the same
I'd give my life for one more night
Of having you here to hold me tight; oh, please
Take me there again
Oh, oh
And I remember how you loved me
Time was all we had until the day we said goodbye
I remember every moment of those endless summer nights
I still recall the walks along the beaches
And the way your hair would glisten in the sun
Rising in the afternoon
Making love to you under the moon, oh
Do you remember all the nights we spent in silence
Every single breath you took was mine
We can have it all again
Say that you'll be with me when the sun brings your heart to mine
Oh, oh
Chorus
There's only so much I can say
So please don't run away from what we have together
It's only you and me tonight
So let's stay lost in flight
Oh, won't you please surrender

Broken hearts and broken dreams
Were over
There was a place where

It started the day when I left you

I could never love again the way that I loved you
I could never cry again like I did when I left you
And when we said goodbye
Oh the look in your eyes
Just left me beside myself without your heart
(Without your heart)
I could never love again now that we're apart

When I was sorry
It was too late to turn around
And tell you so
There was no reason
There was no reason
Just a foolish beat of my heart


Oh, can't you see I'm not fooling nobody
Don't you see the tears are falling down my face?
Since you went away
Break my heart, you slipped away
Didn't know I was wrong
Never meant to hurt you now you're gone
I could never love again now that we're apart

I could never love again now that we're apart"

Won't they always love you?

Prelude
O wondrous legends from the storied wells
Of lost Baranton! where old Merlin dwells,
Nodding a white poll and a grave, gray beard,
As if some Lake Ladyé he, listening, heard,
Who spake like water, danced like careful showers
With blown gold curls through drifts of wild-thorn flowers;
Loose, lazy arms upon her bosom crossed,
An instant seen, and in an instant lost,
With one peculiar note, like that you hear
Dropped by a reed-bird when the night is near,
A vocal gold blown through the atmosphere.
Lo! dreams from dreams in dreams remembered. Naught
That matters much, save that it seemed I thought
I wandered dim with some one, but I knew
Not whom; most beautiful, and young, and true,
And pale through suffering: with curl-crowned brow
Soft eyes and voice, so strange, they haunt me now—
A dream, perhaps, in dreamland.
Seemed that she
Led me along a flower-showered lea
Trammeled with puckered pansy and the pea;
Where poppies spread great blood-red stain on stain,
So gorged with sunlight and the honeyed rain
Their hearts were weary; roses lavished beams;
Roses, wherein were huddled little dreams
That laughed coy, sidewise merriment, like dew,
Or from fair fingers fragrant kisses blew.
And suddenly a river cleft the sward;
And o'er it lay a mist: and it was hard
To see whence came it; whitherward it led;
Like some wild, frightened thing, it foamed and fled,
Sighing and murmuring, from its fountain-head.
And following it, at last I came upon
The Region of Romance,—from whence were drawn
Its wandering waters,—and the storied wells
Of lost Baranton, where old Merlin dwells,
Nodding a white poll and a great, gray beard.
And then, far off, a woman's voice I heard,
Wilder than water, laughing in the bowers,
Like some strange bird: and then, through wild-thorn flowers,
I saw her limbs glance, twinkling as spring showers;
And then, with blown gold curls, tempestuous tossed,
White as a wood-nymph, she a vista crossed,
Laughing that laugh wherein there was no cheer,
But soulless scorn. And so to me drew near
Her sweet lascivious brow's white wonderment,
And gray, great eyes, and hair which had the scent
Of all the wild Brécèliande's perfumes
Drowned in it; and, a flame in gold, one bloom's
Blood-point thrust deep. And, ""Viviane! Viviane!""
The wild seemed crying, as if swept with rain;
And all the young leaves laughed; and surge on surge
Swept the witch-haunted forest to its verge,
That shook and sighed and stammered, as, in sleep,
A giant half-aroused: and, with a leap,
That samite-hazy creature, blossom-white,
Showered mocking kisses down; then, like a light
Beat into gusty flutterings by the dawn,
Then quenched, she glimmered and, behold, was gone;
And in Brécèliande I stood alone
Gazing at Merlin, sitting on a stone;
Old Merlin, charmed there, dreaming drowsy dreams;
A wondrous company; as many as gleams
That stab the moted mazes of a beech.
And each grave dream, behold, had power to reach
My mind through magic; each one following each
In dim procession; and their beauty drew
Tears down my cheeks, and Merlin's gray cheeks, too,—
One in his beard hung tangled, bright as dew.—
Long pageants seemed to pass me, brave and fair,
Of courts and tournaments, with silvery blare
Of immaterial trumpets high in air;
And blazoned banners, shields, and many a spear
Of Uther, waved an incorporeal fear:
And forms of Arthur rose and Guenevere,
Of Tristram and of Isoud and of Mark,
And many others; glimmering in the dark
Of Merlin's mind, they rose and glared and then,—
The instant's fostered phantoms,—passed again.
Then all around me seemed a rippling stir
Of silken something,—wilier, lovelier
Than that witch-mothered beauty, Viviane,—
Approaching with dead knights amid her train,
Pale through the vast Brécèliande. And then
A knight, steel-helmeted, a man of men,
Passed with a fool, King Arthur's Dagonet,
Who on his head a tinsel crown had set
In mockery. And as he went his way,
Behind the knight the leaves began to sway,
Then slightly parted—and Morgane le Fay,
With haughty, wicked eyes and lovely face,
Studied him steadily a little space.

I
""Again I hold thee to my heart, Morgane;
Here where the restless forest hears the main
Toss as in troubled sleep. Now hear me, sweet,
While I that dream of yesternight repeat.""
""First let us find some rock or mossed retreat
Where we may sit at ease.—Why dost thou look
So serious? Nay! learn lightness from this brook,
And gladness from these flowers, my Accolon.
See the wild vista there! where purpling run
Long woodland shadows from the sinking sun;
Deeper the wood seems there, secluded as
The tame wild-deer that, in the moss and grass,
Gaze with their human eyes. Where grow those lines
Of pale-starred green; and where yon fountain shines,
Urned deep in tremulous ferns, let's rest upon
Yon oak-trunk by the tempest overthrown
Years, years ago. See, how 'tis rotted brown!
But here the red bark's firm and overgrown
Of trailing ivy darkly berried. Share
My throne with me. Come, cast away thy care!
Sit here and breathe with me this wildwood air,
Musk with the wood's decay that fills each way;
As if some shrub, while dreaming of the May,
In longing languor weakly tried to wake
Its perished blossoms and could only make
Ghosts of such dead aromas as it knew,
And shape a spectre of invisible dew
To haunt these sounding miles of solitude.""
""Still, thou art troubled, Morgane! and the mood,
Deep in thy fathomless eyes, glows.—Canst not keep
Mine eyes from seeing!—Dark thy thought and deep
As that of some wild woman,—found asleep
By some lost knight upon a precipice,—
Whom he hath wakened with a sudden kiss:
As that of some frail elfin lady,—light
As are the foggy moonbeams,—filmy white,
Who waves diaphanous beauty on a cliff,
That, drowsing, purrs with moon-drenched pines; but if
The lone knight follow, foul fiends rise and drag
Him crashing down, while she, tall on the crag,
Triumphant, mocks him with glad sorcery
Till all the wildwood echoes shout with glee.""
""Follow thy figure further, Accolon.
Right fair it is. Too soon, alas! art done,""
Said she; and tossing back her heavy hair,
Said smilingly, yet with a certain air
Of hurt impatience, ""Why dost not compare
This dark expression of my eyes, ah me!
To something darker? say, it is to thee
As some bewildering mystery of a tarn,
A mountain water, that the mornings scorn
To anadem with fire and leave gray;
To which a champion cometh when the day
Hath tired of breding for the twilight's head
Flame-petaled blooms, and, golden-chapleted,
Sits waiting, rosy with deep love, for night,
Who cometh sandaled with the moon; the light
Of the auroras round her; her vast hair
Tortuous with stars,—that burn, as in a lair
The eyes of hunted wild things glare with rage,—
And on her bosom doth his love assuage.""
""Yea, even so,"" said Accolon, his eyes
Searching her face: ""the knight, as I surmise,
Who cometh heated to that haunted place,
Stoops down to lave his forehead, and his face
Meets fairy faces; elfins in a ring
That shadow upward, smiling, beckoning
Down, down to wonders, magic built of old
For some dim witch.—A city walled with gold,
With beryl battlements and paved with pearls;
Its lambent towers wrought of foamy swirls
Of alabaster; and that witch to love
More beautiful than any queen above.—
He pauses, troubled: but a wizard power,
In all his bronzen harness, that mad hour
Plunges him—whither? What if he should miss
Those cloudy beauties and that creature's kiss?—
Ah, Morgane, that same power Accolon
Found potent in thine eyes, and it hath drawn
And plunged him—whither? yea, to what far fate?
To what dim end? what veiled and future state?""
With shadowy eyes long, long she gazed in his,
Then whispered dreamily the one word, ""Bliss.""
And like an echo on his sad mouth sate
The answer:—""Bliss?—deep have we drunk of late!
But death, I feel, some stealthy-footed death
Draws near! whose claws will clutch away—whose breath? . . .
I dreamed last night thou gather'dst flowers with me,
Fairer than those of earth. And I did see
How woolly gold they were, how woven through
With fluffy flame, and webby with spun dew:
And 'Asphodels' I murmured: then, 'These sure
Are Eden amaranths, so angel pure
That love alone may touch them.'—Thou didst lay
The flowers in my hands; alas! then gray
The world grew; and, meseemed, I passed away.
In some strange manner on a misty brook,
Between us flowing, striving still to look
Beyond it, while, around, the wild air shook
With torn farewells of pensive melody,
Aching with tears and hopeless utterly;
So merciless near, meseemed that I did hear
That music in those flowers, and yearned to tear
Their ingot-cored and gold-crowned hearts, and hush
Their voices into silence and to crush:
Yet o'er me was a something that restrained:
The melancholy presence of two pained
And awful, burning eyes that cowed and held
My spirit while that music died or swelled
Far out on shoreless waters, borne away—
Like some wild-bird, that, blinded with the ray
Of dawn it wings tow'rds, lifting high its crest,
The glory round it, sings its heavenliest,
When suddenly all's changed; with drooping head,
Daggered of thorns it plunged on, fluttering, dead,
Still, still it seems to sing, though wrapped in night,
The slow blood beading on its breast of white.—
And then I knew the flowers which thou hadst given
Were strays of parting grief and waifs of heaven
For tears and memories. Importunate
They spoke to me of loves that separate!—
But, God! ah God! my God! thus was I left!
And these were with me who was so bereft.
The haunting torment of that dream of grief
Weighs on my soul and gives me no relief.""
He bowed and wept into his hands; and she,
Sorrowing beheld. Then, resting at her knee,
Raised slow her oblong lute and smote some chords.
But ere the impulse saddened into words,
Said: ""And didst love me as thy lips would prove,
No visions wrought of sleep might move thy love.
Firm is all love in firmness of his power;
With flame, reverberant, moated stands his tower;
So built as not to admit from fact a beam
Of doubt, and much less of a doubt from dream:
All such th' alchemic fire of love's desires,—
That moats its tower with flame,—turns to gold wires
To chord the old lyre new whereon he lyres.""
She ceased; and then, sad softness in her eye,
Sang to his dream a questioning reply:—
""Will love be less, when dead the roguish Spring,
Who, with white hands, sowed violets, whispering?
When petals of her cheeks, wan-wasted through
Of withering grief, are laid beneath the dew,
Will love be less?
""Will love be less, when comes the Summer tall?
Her throat a lily, long and spiritual:
When like a poppied swath,—hushed haunt of bees,—
Her form is laid in slumber on the leas,
Will love be less?
""Will love be less, when Autumn, sighing there,
Droops with long frost streaks in her dark, dark hair?
When her grave eyes are closed to heaven above,
Deep, lost in memory's melancholy, love,
Will love be less?
""Will love be less, when Winter at the door
Shakes from gray locks th' icicles, long and hoar?
When Death's eyes, hollow o'er his shoulder, dart
Dark looks that wring with tears, then freeze the heart,
Will love be less?""
And in her hair wept softly, and her breast
Rose and was wet with tears—as when, distressed,
Night steals on day, rain sobbing through her curls.—
""Though tears become thee even as priceless pearls,
Weep not, Morgane.—Mine no gloom of doubt,
But grief for sweet love's death I dreamed about,""
He said. ""May love, the flame-anointed, be
Lord of our hearts, and king eternally!
Love, ruler of our lives, whose power shall cease
No majesty when we are laid at peace;
But still shall reign, when souls have loved thus well,
Our god in Heaven or our god in Hell.""
So they communed. Afar her castle stood,
Its slender towers glimmering through the wood:
A forest lodge rose, ivy-buried, near
A woodland vista where faint herds of deer
Stalked like soft shadows: where, with many a run,
Mavis and throstle caroled in the sun:
And where through trees was seen a surf-white shore.
For this was Morgane's realm, embowered Gore;
And that her castle, sea-built Chariot,
That rooky pile, where, she a while forgot
Urience, her husband, now at Camelot.
Hurt in that battle where King Arthur strove
With the Five Heathen Kings, and, slaying, drove
The Five before him, Accolon was borne
To a gray castle on his shield one morn;—
A castle like a dream, set high in scorn
Above the world and all its hungry herds,
Belted with woods melodious with birds,
Far from the rush of spears and roar of swords,
And the loud shields of battle-bloody lords,
And fields of silent slain where Havoc sprawled
Gorged to her eyes with carnage.—Dim, high-halled,
And hushed it rose; and through the granite-walled
Huge gate, and court, up stairs of marble sheen,
Six damsels bore him, tiremaids of a queen,
Stately and dark, who moved as if a flame
Of starlight shone around her; and who came
With healing herbs and searched his wounds. A dame,
So radiant in raiment silvery,
So white, that she attendant seemed to be
On that high Holy Grail, which evermore
The Table Round hath sought by wood and shore;
The angel-guarded cup of mystery,
That but the pure in body and soul may see;—
Thus not for him, a worldly one, to love,
Who loved her even to wonder; skied above
His worship as the moon above the main,
That strives and strives to reach her, pale with pain,
She with her peaceful, pitiless, virgin cheer
Watching his suffering year on weary year.—
To Accolon such seemed she: Then, too late,
His heart's ideal, merciless as fate!
For whom his soul must yearn till death; and wait
And dream of; evermore with sighs and tears,
Through the long waste of unavailing years,
Seeing her ever luminously stand
In luminous heavens, beckoning with her hand:
Before which vision heart and soul were weak,
And dumb with love, that would, yet could not speak.—
Her beauty filled him with divine despair.
Around his heart she seemed to wrap her hair,
Her raven hair, and drag him to his doom;
Her looks were splendid daggers in the gloom
Of his sick soul, his heart's invaded tower,
Stabbing, yet never slaying, every hour.
Thus worshiping that queen, Morgane le Fay,
For many a day within his room he lay,
Longing to live now, then again to die,
As now her face, or now her glancing eye,
Bade his heart hope, with smiled approval of
His passion; now despair, with scorn of love;
His love, that dragged itself before her feet,
Dog-like, to whom even a blow were sweet.
Ah, never dreamed he of what was to be,—
Nay, nay! how could he? while the agony
Of his unworth possessed his soul so much,
He never thought such loveliness and such
Perfection ever could stoop from its heaven,
Far as his world, and to his arms be given.
One night a tempest tore and tossed and lashed
The writhing forest, and deep thunders dashed
Sonorous shields together; and anon,
Vast in the thunder's pause, the sea would groan
Like some enormous curse a knight hath lured
From where it soared to maim it with his sword.
And Accolon, from where he lay, could see
The stormy, wide-wrenched night's immensity
Yawn hells of golden ghastliness, and sweep
Distending foam, tempestuous, up each steep
Of raucous iron. In a fever-fit,
He seemed to see, on crags the lightning lit,
With tangled hair wild-blown, nude mermaids sit,
Singing, and beckoning with foam-white arms
Some far ship struggling with the strangling storm's
Resistless exultation. And there came
One breaker, mountained heavenward, all aflame
With glow-worm green, that boomed against the cliff
Its bulkéd thunder—and there, pale and stiff,
Tumbled in eddies of the howling rocks,
His dead, drawn face, with lidless eyes, and locks
Oozed close with brine; hurled upward streamingly
To streaming mermaids. Then he seemed to see
The vampire echoes of the hoarse wood, who,
With hooting, sought him: down the casement drew
Wet, shuddering, hag-like fingers; and, at last,
Thronged up the turrets with an elfin blast
Of baffled mockery, and whirled wildly off,
Back to the forest with a maniac scoff.—
Then, far away, hoofs of a hundred gales,
As wave rams wave up windy bluffs of Wales,
Loosed from the battlemented hills, the loud
Herders of tempest drove their herds of cloud,
That down the rocking night rolled, with the glare
Of swimming eyeballs, and the hurl of hair,
Blown, black as rain, from misty-manéd brows,
And mouths of bellowing storm; in mad carouse,
With whips of wind, rolling and ruining by,
Headlong, along the wild and headlong sky.
Once when the lightning made the casement glare,
Squares touched to gold, athwart it swept her hair,
As if a raven's wing had cut the storm
Death-driven seaward. And the vague alarm
Of her swift coming filled his soul with hope
And wild surmise, that winged beyond the scope
Of all his dreams had dreamed of, when he saw
'Twas she, the all-adored. He felt no awe
When low she kneeled beside him, beautiful
As some lone star and white, and said, ""To lull
Thy soul to sleep, lo, I have come to thee.—
Didst thou not call me?""—
""Yea;"" he said. ""Maybe
Thou heard'st my heart, that calls continually:
But with my lips I called thee not. But, stay!
The night is wild. Thou wilt not go away!
The night is wild, and it is long till day!
To see thee like a benediction near,
To hear thy voice, to have thy cool hand here
Smoothing my feverish brow and matted curls;
To see thy white throat, whiter than its pearls,
Lean o'er me breathing; feel the influence
Of thy large eyes, like stars, whose sole defence
Against all storm is beauty,—is to see
And feel a portion of divinity,
My heart's high dream come true, my dream of dreams!—""
Then paused and said, ""See, how the tempest streams!
How sweeps the tumult! and the thunder gleams
As, when King Arthur charged on battle-fields
Of Humber, glared the fiery spears and shields
Of all his knights!—when the Five Kings went down!
In the wild hurl of onset overthrown. . . .
But thy white presence, like the moon, has sown
This room with calm; and all the storm in me,
The tempest of my soul, dies utterly.
So let me feel thy hand upon my cheek.
And speak! I love thy voice: belovéd, speak.""
""Thou lov'st a thing of air, fond Accolon!
Is thy love then so spiritual? Nay! anon
'T will change, methinks. Whatever may befall,
Earth-love, thou 'lt find, is better, after all.""—
She smiled; and, sudden, through the moon-rent wall
Of storm, baptizing moonlight, foot and face,
Bathed and possessed her, as his soul the grace
And sweetness of her smile, whose life was brief,
But long enough to heal him of his grief.
""Now rest,"" she said; ""I love thee with much love!—
Thou didst not know I loved: but God above,
He knew and had divinement.—Winds may blow!—
To lie by thee to-night my mind is. So,""—
She laughed,—""sleep well!—For me . . . give me thy word
Of knighthood!—look thou! . . . and this naked sword
Laid here betwixt us! . . . Let it be a wall
Strong between love and lust an lov'st me all in all.""
Then she unbound the gold that clasped her waist:
Undid her hair: and, like a flower faced,
Stood sweet an unswayed stem that ran to bud
In bloom and beauty of young womanhood.
And fragrance was to her as natural
As odor to the rose. And white and tall,
All ardor and all fervor, through the room
She moved, a presence as of pale perfume.
And all his eyes and lips and limbs were fire:
His tongue, delirious, babbled of desire;
Cried, ""Thine is devil's kindness, which is even
Worse than fiend's fury, since the soul sees Heaven
Among eternal torments unforgiven.
Temptation neighbored, like a bloody rust
On a bright blade, leaves ugly stains; and lust
Is love's undoing when love's limbs are cast
Naked before desire. What love so chaste
But that such nearness of what should be hid
Makes it a lawless love?—But thou hast bid.
Rest thou. I love thee; love thee as dost know,
And all my love shall battle with love's foe.""
""Thy word,"" she said. And pure as peaks that keep
Snow-drifted crowns, upon him seemed to sweep
An avalanche of virtue in one look.
And he, whose very soul within him shook,
Exclaimed, ""'T is thine!""—And hopes, that in his brain
Had risen with rainbow gleams, set sad as rain
At that high look she gave of chastest pain.
Then turned, his face deep in his hands: and she
Laid the broad blade between them instantly.
And so they lay its iron between them twain:
Unsleeping he, for all the brute disdain
Of passion in him struggled up and stood
A rebel wrangling with the brain and blood.
An hour stole by: she slept, or seemed to sleep.
The winds of night blew vigorous from the deep
With rain-scents of storm-watered wood and wold,
And breathed of ocean breakers moonlight-rolled.
He drowsed; and time passed stealing as for one
Whose life is but a dream in Avalon.
Vast bulks of black, wind-shattered rack went by
The casement's square of heaven,—a crystal dye,
A crown of moonlight, round each cloudy head,—
That seemed the ghosts of giant kings long-dead.
And then he thought she lightly laughed and sighed,
So soft a taper had not bent aside,
And leaned her warm face, seen through loosened hair,
Above him, whispering, soft as is a prayer,
""Behold! the sword! I take the sword away!""
It curved and clashed where the strewn rushes lay;
Shone glassy, glittering like a watery beam
Of moonlight, in the moonlight. He did deem
She moved in sleep and dreamed perverse nor wist
The thing she did, until two hot lips kissed
His wondering eyes to knowledge of her thought.
Then said he, ""Love, my word! is it then naught?""
But now he felt fierce kisses over and over,
And laughter of ""Thy word?—Art thou my lover?—
Kisses are more than words!—Come, give them me!—
As for thy word—I give it back to thee!""
Sleep is a spirit, who beside us sits,
Or through our frames like some dim glamour flits;
From out her form a pearly light is shed,
As, from a lily in a lily-bed,
A firefly's gleam. Her face is pale as stone,
Uncertain as a cloud that lies alone
In empty heaven; her diaphanous feet
Are easy as the dew or opaline heat
Of summer meads. With ears—aurora-pink
As dawn's—she leans and listens on the brink
Of being, dark with dreadfulness and doubt,
Wherein vague lights and shadows move about,
And palpitations beat—like some huge heart
Of Earth—the surging pulse of which we're part.
One hand, that hollows her divining eyes,
Glows like the curved moon over twilight skies;
And with her gaze she fathoms life and death—
Gulfs, where man's conscience, like a restless breath
Of wind, goes wandering; whispering low of things,
The irremediable, where sorrow clings.
Around her limbs a veil of woven mist
Wavers, and turns from fibered amethyst
To textured crystal; through which symboled bars
Of silver burn, and cabalistic stars
Of nebulous gold. Shrouding her feet and hair,
Within this woof, fantastic, everywhere,
Dreams come and go: the instant images
Of things she sees and thinks; realities,
Shadows, with which her heart and fancy swarm,
That in the veil take momentary form:
Now picturing heaven in celestial fire,
And now the hell of every soul's desire;
Hinting at worlds, God wraps in mystery,
Beyond the world we touch and know and see.
No, never,—no!—would they forget that night.—
Too soon the sleepy birds awoke the light!
Too soon, for them, trailing gray skirts of breeze,
The drowsy dawn came wandering through the trees.
""Too soon,"" she sighed; and he, ""Alas! too soon!""
But at their scutcheoned casement, overstrewn
Of dew and dreams, the dim wind knocked and cried,
""Arise! come forth, O bridegroom, and O bride!""

II
Morn; and the Autumn, dreaming, sat among
His ancient hills; Autumn, who now was wrung
By crafty ministers, sun, rain, and frost,
To don imperial pomp at any cost.
On each wild hill he reared his tents of war,
Flaunting barbaric standards wide and far,
Around which camp-fires of the red leaves raged:
His tottering state by flattering zephyrs paged,
Who, in a little fretful while, would soon
Work red rebellion under some wan moon:
Pluck his old beard, deriding; shriek and tear
His royalty; and scatter through the air
His tattered majesty: then from his head
Dash down its golden crown; and in its stead
Set up a death's-head mockery of snow,
And leave him stripped, a beggar bowed with woe.
Blow, wood wind, blow! the day is fair and fine
As autumn skies can make it; brisk as brine
The air is, rustling in the underbrush,
'Mid which the stag-hounds leap, the huntsmen rush.
Hark to the horns! the music of the bows!
À mort! à mort!—The hunt is up and goes,
Beneath the acorn-dropping oaks, in green,—
Dark woodland green,—a boar-spear held between
His selle and hunter's head; and at his thigh
A good broad hanger; and one hand on high
To wind his horn, that startles many a wing,
And makes the forest echoes reel and ring.
Away, away they flash, a belted band
From Camelot, through the haze-haunted land:
With many a leamer leashed, and many a hound,
With mouths of bell-like music, now that bound,
Uncoupled, forward; for, behold! the hart,
A ten-tined buck, doth from the covert dart.
And the big stag-hounds swing into the chase,
The wild horns sing. The pryce seems but a pace
On ere 'tis wound. But, see! where interlace
The dense-briared thickets, now the hounds have lost
The slot, there where their woodland way is crossed
By intercepting waters full of leaves.
Beyond, the hart a tangled labyrinth weaves
Through deeper boscage; and it seems the sun
Makes many shadowy stags of this wild one,
That lead in different trails the foresters:
And in the trees the ceaseless wind, that stirs,
Seems some strange witchcraft, that, with baffling mirth,
Mocks them the unbayed hart, and fills the earth
With rustling sounds of running.—Hastening thence,
Galloped King Arthur and King Urience,
With one small brachet-hound. Now far away
They heard their fellowship's faint horns; and day
Wore on to noon; yet, there before them, they
Still saw the hart plunge bravely through the brake,
Leaving the bracken shaking in his wake:
And on they followed; on, through many a copse,
Above whose brush, close on before, the tops
Of the great antlers swelled anon, then, lo,
Were gone where beat the heather to and fro.
But still they drave him hard; and ever near
Seemed that great hart unwearied, and 'twas clear
The chase would yet be long, when Arthur's horse
Gasped mightily and, lunging in his course,
Lay dead, a lordly bay; and Urience
Reined his gray hunter, laboring. And thence
King Arthur went afoot. When suddenly
He was aware of a wide waste of sea,
And, near the wood, the hart upon the sward,
Bayed, panting unto death and winded hard.
So with his sword he slew him; then the pryce
Wound loudly on his hunting-bugle thrice.
As if each echo, which that wild horn's blast
Roused from its sleep,—the solitude had cast
For ages on it,—had, a silvery band
Of moving sounds of gladness, hand in hand
Arisen,—each a visible delight,—
Came three fair damsels, sunny in snowy white,
From the red woodland gliding. They the knight,—
For so they deemed the King, who came alone,—
Graced with obeisance. And, ""Our lord,"" said one,
""Tenders you courtesy until the dawn,
The Earl, Sir Damas. For the day is gone,
And you are weary. Safe in his strong keep,
Led thither with due worship, you shall sleep.""
And so he came, o'erwearied, to a hall,
An owlet-haunted pile, whose weedy wall
Towered, rock on rock; its turrets, crowding high,
Loomed, ancient as the crags, against a sky
Wherein the moon hung, owl-eyed, round and full:
An old, gaunt giant-castle, like a gull
Hung on the weedy cliffs, where broke the dull
Vast monotone of ocean, that uprolled
Its windy waters; and where all was old,
And sad, and swept of winds, and slain of salt,
And haunted grim of ruin: where the vault
Of heav'n bent ever, clamorous as the rout
Of the defiant headlands, stretching out
Into the night, with their voluminous shout
Of wreck and wrath forever. Arthur then,
Among the gaunt Earl's followers, swarthy men,
Ate in the wild hall. Then a damsel led,
With flaring torch, the tired King to bed,
Down lonely labyrinths of that corridored keep.
And soon he rested, sunk in heavy sleep.
Then suddenly he woke; it seemed, 'mid groans
And dolorous sighs: and round him lay the bones
Of many men, and bodies mouldering.
And he could hear the wind-swept ocean swing
Its sighing surge above. And so he thought,
""It is some nightmare weighing me, distraught
By that long hunt."" And then he sought to shake
The horror off and to himself awake.
But still he heard sad groans and whispering sighs:
And gaunt, from iron-ribbéd cells, the eyes
Of pale, cadaverous knights regarded him,
Unhappy: and he felt his senses swim
With foulness of that dungeon.—""What are ye?
Ghosts? or chained champions? or a company
Of fiends?"" he cried. Then, ""Speak! if speak ye can!
Speak, in God's name! for I am here—a man!""
Then groaned the shaggy throat of one who lay,
A wasted nightmare, dying day by day,
Yet once a knight of comeliness, and strong
And great and young, but now, through hunger long,
A skeleton with hollow hands and cheeks:—
""Sir knight,"" said he, ""know that the wretch who speaks
Is only one of twenty knights entombed
By Damas here; the Earl who so hath doomed
Us in this dungeon, where starvation lairs;
Around you lie the bones, whence famine stares,
Of many knights. And would to God that soon
My liberated ghost might see the moon
Freed from the horror of this prisonment!""
With that he sighed, and round the dungeon went
A rustling sigh, as of the damned; and so
Another dim, thin voice complained their woe:
""Know, he doth starve us to obtain this end:
Because not one of us his strength will lend
To battle for what still he calls his rights,
This castle and its lands. For, of all knights,
He is most base; lacks most in hardihood.
A younger brother, Ontzlake, hath he; good
And courteous; withal most noble; whom
This Damas hates—yea, even seeks his doom;
Denying him to his estate all right
Save that he holds by main of arms and might.
Through puissance hath Ontzlake some few fields
And one right sumptuous manor, where he deals
With knights as knights should, with an open hand,
Though ill he can afford it. Through the land
He is far-famed for hospitality.
Ontzlake is brave, but Damas cowardly.
For Ontzlake would decide with sword and lance,
Body to body, this inheritance:
But Damas, vile as he is courageless,
Doth on all knights, his guests, lay this duress,
To fight for him or starve. For you must know
That in this country he is hated so
There is no champion who will take the fight.
Thus fortunes it our plight is such a plight.""
Quoth he and ceased. And, wondering at the tale,
The King lay silent, while each wasted, pale,
Poor countenance perused him; then he spake:
""And what reward if one this cause should take?""—
""Deliverance for all if of us one
Consent to be his party's champion.
But treachery and he are so close kin
We loathe the part as some misshapen sin;
And here would rather with the rats find death
Than, serving him, serve wrong, and save our breath,
And on our heads, perhaps, bring down God's curse.""
""May God deliver you in mercy, sirs,
And help us all!"" said Arthur. At which word
Straightway a groaning sound of iron was heard,
Of chains rushed loose and bolts jarred rusty back,
And hoarse the gate croaked open; and the black
Of that rank cell astonished was with light,
That danced fantastic with the frantic night.
One high torch, sidewise worried by the gust,
Sunned that dark den of hunger, death and dust;
And one tall damsel, vaguely vestured, fair,
With shadowy hair, poised on the rocky stair:
And laughing on the King, ""What cheer?"" said she.
""God's life! the keep stinks vilely! And to see
Such noble knights endungeoned, starving here,
Doth pain me sore with pity. But, what cheer?""
""Thou mockest us. For me, the sorriest
Since I was suckled; and of any quest
This is the most imperiling and strange.—
But what wouldst thou?"" said Arthur. She,
""A change
I offer thee; through thee to these with thee,
If thou wilt promise, in love's courtesy,
To fight for Damas and his brotherhood.
And if thou wilt not—look! behold this brood
Of lean and dwindled bellies, spectre-eyed,—
Keen knights once,—who refused me. So decide.""
Then thought the King of the sweet sky, the breeze
That blew delirious over waves and trees;
Thick fields of grasses and the sunny Earth,
Whose beating heat filled the high heart with mirth,
And made the world one sovereign pleasure-house
Where king and serf might revel and carouse:
Then of the hunt on autumn-plaintive hills;
Lone forest lodges by their radiant rills;
His palace at Caerleon upon Usk,
And Camelot's loud halls that through the dusk
Blazed far and bloomed, a rose of revelry;
Or, in the misty morning, shadowy
Loomed, grave with audience. And then he thought
Of his Round Table, and the Grael wide sought
In haunted holds by many a haunted shore.
Then marveled of what wars would rise and roar
With dragon heads unconquered and devour
This realm of Britain and crush out that flower
Of chivalry whence ripened his renown:
And then the reign of some besotted crown,
Some bandit king of lust, idolatry—
And with that thought for tears he could not see.—
Then of his best-loved champions, King Ban's son,
And Galahad and Tristram, Accolon:
And then, ah God! of his loved Guenevere:
And with that thought—to starve 'mid horrors here!—
For, being unfriend to Arthur and his Court,
Well knew he this grim Earl would bless that sport
Of fortune which had fortuned him so well
As t' have his King to starve within a cell,
In the entombing rock beside the deep.—
And all the life, large in his limbs, did leap
Through eager veins and sinews, fierce and red,
Stung on to action; and he rose and said:
""That which thou askest is right hard, but, lo!
To rot here, harder. I will fight his foe.
But, mark, I have no weapons and no mail;
No steed against that other to avail.""
She laughed again; ""If we must beg or hire,
Fear not for that: these thou shalt lack not, sire.""
And so she led the way; her torch's fire
Sprawling with spidery shadows at each stride
The cob-webbed coignes of scowling arches wide.
At length they reached an iron-studded door,
Which she unlocked with one harsh key she bore
'Mid many keys bunched at her girdle; thence
They issued on a terraced eminence.
Below, the sea broke sounding; and the King
Breathed open air again that had the sting
And scent of brine, the far, blue-billowed foam:
And in the east the second dawning's gloam,
Since that unlucky chase, was freaked with streaks
Red as the ripe stripes of an apple's cheeks.
And so, within that larger light of dawn
It seemed to Arthur now that he had known
This maiden at his Court, and so he asked.
But she, well tutored, her real person masked,
And answered falsely, ""Nay, deceive thee not.
Thou saw'st me ne'er at Arthur's Court, I wot.
For here it likes me best to sing and spin,
And needle hangings, listening to the din
Of ocean, sitting some high tower within.
No courts or tournaments or hunts I crave,
No knights to flatter me! For me—the wave,
The cliffs, the sea and sky, in calm or storm;
My garth, wherein I walk at morn; the charm
Of ocean, redolent at bounteous noon,
And sprayed with sunlight; night's free stars and moon:
White ships that pass, some several every year;
These ancient towers; and those wild mews to hear.""
""An owlet maid,"" the King laughed.—But untrue
Was she, and of false Morgane's treasonous crew,
Deep in intrigues, even for the slaying of
The King, her brother, whom she did not love.—
And presently she brought him where, in state,
This swarthy Damas, 'mid his wildmen sate.
And Accolon, at Castle Chariot still,
Had lost long weeks in love. Her husband ill,
Morgane, perforce, must leave her lover here
Among the hills of Gore. A lodge stood near
A cascade in the forest, where their wont
Was to sit listening the falling fount,
That, through sweet talks of many idle hours
On moss-banks, varied with the violet flowers,
Had learned the lovers' language,—sighed above,—
And seemed, in every fall, to whisper, ""love"";
That echoed through the lodge, her hands had draped
With curious hangings; where were worked and shaped
Remembered hours of pleasure, body and soul;
Imperishable passions, which made whole
The past again in pictures; and could mate
The heart with loves long dead; and re-create
The very kisses of those perished knights
With woven records of long-dead delights.
Below the lodge within an urnéd shell
The water pooled, and made a tinkling well,
Then, slipping thence, through dripping shadows fell
From rippling rock to rock. Here Accolon,
With Morgane's hollow lute, as eve drew on
Came all alone: not ev'n her brindled hound
To bound before him o'er the gleaming ground;
No handmaid lovely of his loveliest fair,
Or paging dwarf in purple with him there;
Only her lute, about which her perfume
Clung, odorous of memories, that made bloom
Her absent features, making them arise,
Like some rich flower, before his memory's eyes,
That seemed to see her lips and to surmise
The words they fashioned; then the smile that drank
Her soul's deep fire from eyes wherein it sank
And slowly waned away to deeper dreams,
Fathomless with thought, down in their dove-gray streams.
And so for her imagined eyes and lips,
Heart-fashioned features, all the music slips
Of all his soul, himseems, into his voice,
To sing her praises. And, with nervous poise,
His fleet, trained fingers waken in her lute
Such mellow riot as must make envy-mute
The nightingale that listens quivering.
And well he hopes that, winging thence, 't will sing
A similar song;—whose passions burn and pain
Its anguished soul, now silent,—not in vain
Beneath her casement, in that garden old
Dingled with heavy roses; in the gold
Of Camelot's stars and pearl-encrusted moon:
And still he hopes the heartache of the tune
Will clamor secret memories in her ear,
Of life, less dear than death with her not near;
Of love, who longs for her, to have her here:
Till melt her eyes with tears; and sighs and sobs
O'erwhelm her soul, and separation throbs
Hard at her heart, that, longing, lifts to death
A prayerful pleading, crying, ""But a breath,
One moment of real heaven, there! in his arms!
Close, close! And, for that moment, then these charms,
This body, hell, canst have forevermore!""
And sweet to know, perhaps its song will pour
Into the dull ear of her drowsy lord
A vague suspicion of some secret word,
Borne by the bird,—love's wingéd messenger,—
To her who lies beside him; even her,
His wife, whom still he loves; whom Accolon
Thus sings of where the woods of Gore grow wan:—
""The thought of thy white coming, like a song
Breathed soft of lovely lips and lute-like tongue,
Sways all my bosom with a sweet unrest;
Makes wild my heart that oft thy heart hath pressed.—
Come! press it once again, for it is strong
To bear that weight which never yet distressed.
""O come! and straight the woodland is stormed through
With wilder wings, and brighter with bright dew:
And every flow'r, where thy fair feet have passed,
Puts forth a fairer blossom than the last,
Thrilled of thine eyes, those arsenals of blue,
Wherein the arrows of all love are cast.
""O Love, she comes! O Love, I feel her breath,
Like the soft South, that idly wandereth
Through musical leaves of laughing laziness,
Page on before her, how sweet,—none can guess:
Sighing, 'She comes! thy heart's dear life and death;
In whom is all thy bliss and thy distress.'
""She comes! she comes! and all my mind doth rave
For words to tell her how she doth enslave
My soul with beauty: then o'erwhelm with love
That loveliness, no words can tell whereof;
Words, words, like roses, every path to pave,
Each path to strew, and no word sweet enough!
""She comes!—Thro' me a passion—as the moon
Works wonder in the sea—through me doth swoon
Ungovernable glory; and her soul
Seems blent with mine; and now, to some bright goal,
Compels me, throbbing like a tender tune,
Exhausting all my efforts of control.
""She comes! ah, God! ye little stars that grace
The fragmentary skies, and scatter space,
Brighter her steps that golden all my gloom!
Ah, wood-indulging, violet-vague perfume,
Sweeter the presence of her wild-flower face,
That fragrance-fills my life, and stars with bloom!
""Oh, boundless exultation of the blood!
That now compels me to some higher mood,
Diviner sense of something that outsoars
The Earth—her kiss! that all love's splendor pours
Into me; all delicious womanhood,
So all the heart that hesitates—adores.
""Sweet, my soul's victor! heart's triumphant Sweet!
Within thy bosom Love hath raised his seat;
There he sits crowned; and, from thy eyes and hair,
Shoots his soft arrows,—as the moonbeams fair,—
That long have laid me supine at thy feet,
And changed my clay to ardent fire and air.
""My love! my witch! whose kiss, like some wild wine,
Has subtly filled me with a flame divine,
An aspiration, whose fierce pulses urge
In all my veins, with rosy surge on surge,
To hurl me in that heaven, all which is mine,
Thine arms! from which I never would emerge.""
His ecstasy the very foliage shook;
The wood seemed hushed to hear, and hushed the brook;
And even the heavens, wherein one star shone clear,
Seemed leaning nearer, his glad song to hear,
To which its wild star throbbed, all golden-pale:
And after which, deep in the purple vale,
Awoke the passion of the nightingale.

III
As one hath seen a green-gowned huntress fair,
Morn in her cheeks and midnight in her hair;
Keen eyes as gray as rain, young limbs as lithe
As the wild fawn's; and silvery voice as blithe
As is the wind that breathes of flowers and dews,
Breast through the bramble-tangled avenues;
Through brier and thorn, that pluck her gown of green,
And snag it here and there,—through which the sheen
Of her white skin gleams rosy;—eyes and face,
Ardent and flushed, fixed on the lordly chase:
So came the Evening to that shadowy wood,
Or so it seemed to Accolon, who stood
Watching the sunset through the solitude.
So Evening came; and shadows cowled the way
Like ghostly pilgrims who kneel down to pray
Before a wayside shrine: and, radiant-rolled,
Along the west, the battlemented gold
Of sunset walled the opal-tinted skies,
That seemed to open gates of Paradise
On soundless hinges of the winds, and blaze
A glory, far within, of chrysoprase,
Towering in topaz through the purple haze.
And from the sunset, down the roseate ways,
To Accolon, who, with his idle lute,
Reclined in revery against the root
Of a great oak, a fragment of the west,
A dwarf, in crimson satin tightly dressed,
Skipped like a leaf the early frosts have burned,
A red oak-leaf; and like a leaf he turned,
And danced and rustled. And it seemed he came
From Camelot; from his belovéd dame,
Morgane le Fay. He on his shoulder bore
A mighty blade, wrought strangely o'er and o'er
With mystic runes, drawn from a scabbard which
Glared venomous, with angry jewels rich.
He, louting to the knight, ""Sir knight,"" said he,
""Your Lady, with all tenderest courtesy,
Assures you—ah, unworthy bearer I
Of her good message!—of her constancy.""
Then, doffing the great baldric, with the sword,
To him he gave them, saying, ""From my lord,
King Arthur: even his Excalibur,
The magic blade which Merlin gat of her,
The Ladye of the Lake, who, as you wot,
Fostered in infanthood Sir Launcelot,
Upon some isle in Briogne's tangled lands
Of meres and mists; where filmy fairy bands,
By lazy moons of summer, dancing, fill
With rings of morrice every grassy hill.
Through her fair favor is this weapon sent,
Who begged it of the King with this intent:
That, for her honor, soon would be begun
A desperate battle with a champion,
Of wondrous prowess, by Sir Accolon:
And with the sword, Excalibur, more sure
Were she that he against him would endure.
Magic the blade, and magic, too, the sheath,
Which, while 'tis worn, wards from the wearer death.""
He ceased: and Accolon held up the sword
Excalibur and said, ""It shall go hard
With him through thee, unconquerable blade,
Whoe'er he be, who on my Queen hath laid
Insult or injury! And hours as slow
As palsied hours in Purgatory go
For those unmassed, till I have slain this foe!—
Here, page, my purse.—And now, to her who gave,
Despatch! and say: To all commands, her slave,
To death obedient, I!—In love or war
Her love to make me all the warrior.—
Bid her have mercy, nor too long delay
From him, who dies an hourly death each day
Till, her white hands kissed, he shall kiss her face,
Through which his life lives on, and still finds grace.""
Thus he commanded. And, incontinent,
The dwarf departed, like a red shaft sent
Into the sunset's sea of scarlet light
Burning through wildwood glooms. And as the night
With votaress cypress veiled the dying strife
Sadly of day, and closed his book of life
And clasped with golden stars, in dreamy thought
Of what this fight was that must soon be fought,
Belting the blade about him, Accolon,
Through the dark woods tow'rds Chariot passed on.
And it befell him thus, the following dawn,
As he was wandering on a dew-drenched lawn,
Glad with the freshness and elastic health
Of sky and earth, that lavished all their wealth
Of heady winds and racy scents,—a knight
And gentle lady met him, gay bedight,
With following of six esquires; and they
Held on gloved wrists the hooded falcon gray,
And rode a-hawking o'er the leas of Gore
From Ontzlake's manor, where he languished; sore
Hurt in the lists, a spear wound in his thigh:
Who had besought—for much he feared to die—
This knight and his fair lady, as they rode
To hawk near Chariot, Morgane's abode,
That they would beg her in all charity
To come to him (for in chirurgery
Of all that land she was the greatest leach),
And her for his recovery beseech.
So, Accolon saluted, they drew rein,
And spake their message, for, right over fain
Were they toward their sport,—that he would bear
Petition to that lady. But, not there
Was Arthur's sister, as they well must wot;
But now a sennight lay at Camelot,
The guest of Guenevere; and with her there
Four other queens of Farther Britain were:
Isoud of Ireland, she of Cornwall Queen,
King Mark's wife,—who right rarely then was seen
At Court for jealousy of Mark, who knew
Her to that lance of Lyonesse how true
Since mutual quaffing of a philter; while
How guilty Guenevere on such could smile:—
She of Northgales and she of Eastland; and
She of the Out Isles Queen. A fairer band,
For sovereignty and love and loveliness,
Was not in any realm to grace and bless.
So Accolon informed them. In distress
Then quoth that knight: ""Ay? see how fortune turns
And varies like an April day, that burns
Now welkins blue with calm; now scowls them down,
Revengeful, with a black storm's wrinkled frown.
For, look! this Damas, who so long hath lain
A hiding vermin, fearful of all pain,
Dark in his bandit towers by the deep,
Wakes from a five years' torpor and a sleep,
And sends despatch a courier to my lord,
Sir Ontzlake, with, 'To-morrow, with the sword,
Earl Damas and his knight, at point of lance,
Decides the issue of inheritance,
Body to body, or by champion.'—
Right hard to find such ere to-morrow dawn.
Though sore bestead lies Ontzlake, if he could,
He would arise and save his livelihood.""
Then thought Sir Accolon: ""One might suppose,
So soon this follows on her message, those
Same things befall through Morgane's arts—who knows?—
Howe'er it be, as 'twere for her own sake,
This battle I myself will undertake.""
Then said to those, ""I know the good Ontzlake.
If he be so conditioned, harried of
Estate and life,—in knighthood and for love
Of justice I his quarrel will assume.
My limbs are keen for armor. Let the groom
Prepare my steed. Right good 'twill be again
To feel him under me.""—Then, of that train,
Asked that one gentleman with him remain,
And men to squire his horse and arms. And then,
When this was granted, mounted with his men
And thence departed. And, ere noontide, they
Came to a lone, dismantled priory
Hard by a castle 'gainst whose square, grey towers,
Machicolated, mossed, in forest bowers,
Full many a siege had beat and onset rushed:
A forest fortress, old and deep-imbushed
In wild and woody hills. And then one wound
A hoarse slug-horn, and at the savage sound
The drawbridge rumbled moatward, clanking, and
Into a paved court rode that little band.
When all the world was morning, gleam and glare
Of autumn glory; and the frost-touched air
Rang with the rooks as rings a silver lyre
Swept swift of minstrel fingers, wire on wire;
Ere that fixed hour of prime, came Arthur, armed
For battle royally. A black steed warmed
A keen impatience 'neath him, cased in mail
Of foreign make; accoutered head and tail
In costly sendal; rearward, wine-dark red,
Amber as sunlight to his fretful head.
Blue armor of linked steel had Arthur on,
Beneath a robe of honor made of drawn,
Ribbed satin, diapered and purfled deep
With lordly gold and purple; whence did sweep
Two acorn-tufted bangles of fine gold:
And at his thigh a falchion, battle-old
And triple-edged; its rune-stamped scabbard, of
Cordovan leather, baldric'd rich above
With new-cut deer-skin, that, laborious wrought,
And curiously, with slides of gold was fraught,
And buckled with a buckle white, that shone,
Tongued red with gold, and carved of walrus' bone.
And, sapphire-set, a burgonet of gold,—
Whereon a wyvern sprawled, whose jaws unrolled
A tongue of garnet agate, of great prize;
Its orbs of glaring ruby, great in size,—
Incased his head and visor-barred his eyes.
And in his hand a wiry lance of ash,
Lattened with sapphire silver, like a flash,
A splinter of sunlight, in the morning's zeal
Glittered, its point, as 'twere, a star of steel.—
A squire attended him; a youth, whose head
Waved many a jaunty curl; whereon a red
Cock-feathered cap shone brave: 'neath which, as keen
As some wild hawk's, his green-gray eyes were seen:
And parti-colored leather shoes he had
Upon his feet; his legs were silken clad
In hose of rarest Totness: and a spear,
Bannered and bronzen, dappled as a deer,
One hand upheld, like some bright beam of morn;
And round his neck was hung a bugle-horn.
So with his following, while, bar on bar,
The blue mist lay on woodside and on scar,
Through mist and dew, through shadow and through ray,
Joustward Earl Damas led the forest way.
Then to King Arthur, when arrived were these
Where bright the lists shone, bannered, through the trees,
A wimpled damsel with a falchion came,
Mounted upon a palfrey, all aflame
With sweat and heat of hurry; and, ""From her,
Your sister, Morgane, your Excalibur!
With tender greeting. For you well may need
Its aid in this adventure. So, God speed!""
Said and departed suddenly: nor knew
The King that this was not his weapon true:
A brittle forgery, in likeness of
That blade, of baser metal;—in unlove
And treason made by her, of all his kin
The nearest, Morgane; who, her end to win,
Stopped at no thing; thinking, with Arthur dead,
The crown would grace her own and Accolon's head.
Then, heralded, into the lists he rode.
Opposed flashed Accolon, whose strength bestrode,
Exultant, strong in talisman of that sword,
A dun horse lofty as a haughty lord,
White-pasterned, and of small, impatient hoof:
Both knight and steed shone armed in mail of proof,
Of yellow-dappled, variegated plate
Of Spanish laton. And of sovereign state
His surcoat robe of honor,—white and black,
Of satin, crimson-orphreyed,—at his back
The wind made billow: and, from forth this robe,
Excalibur,—a throbbing golden globe
Of vicious jewels,—thrust its splendid hilt;
Its broad belt, tawny and with goldwork gilt,
An eyelid clasped, black, of the black seahorse,
Tongued red with rosy gold. And pride and force
Sat on his wingéd helmet, plumed, of rich
Bronze-hammered laton; blazing upon which
A hundred brilliants glittered, thick as on
A silver web bright-studding dews of dawn:
Its crest, a taloned griffin, high that ramped;
In whose horned brow one blood-red gem was stamped.
A spear of ash, long-shafted, overlaid
With azure silver, whereon colors played,
Firm in his iron gauntlet lithely swayed.
Intense on either side the champions stood,
Shining as serpents that, with spring renewed,
In gleaming scales, meet on a wild-wood way,
Their angry tongues flickering at poisonous play.
Then clanged a herald's trumpet: and harsh heels,
Sharp-thrust, each courser felt; the roweled steels
Spurred forward; and the couched and fiery spears,
Flashed, as two bolts of storm the tempest steers
With adverse thunder; and, in middle course,
Crashed full the unpierced shields, and horse from horse
Lashed, madly pawing.—And a hoarse roar rang
From the loud lists, till far the echoes sang
Of hill and rock-hung forest and wild cliff.
Rigid the champions rode where, standing stiff,
Their esquires tendered them the spears they held.
Again the trumpet blew, and, firmly selled,
Forward they galloped, shield to savage shield,
And crest to angry crest: the wyvern reeled,
Towering, against the griffin: scorn and scath
Upon their fiery fronts and in the wrath
Of their gem-blazing eyes: each figure stood
A symbol of the heart beneath the hood.—
The lance of Accolon, as on a rock
The storm-launched foam breaks baffled, with the shock,
On Arthur's sounding shield burst splintered force;
But him resistless Arthur's,—high from horse
Uplifted,—headlong bore, and crashed him down;
A long sword's length unsaddled. Accolon
For one stunned moment lay. Then, rising, drew
The great sword at his hip that shone like dew
Smitten with morn. ""Descend!"" he grimly said,
""To proof of better weapons, head to head!
Enough of spears! to swords!""—And from his height
The King clanged down. And quick, like some swift light,
His moon-bright brand unsheathed. And, hollowed high,
Each covering shield gleamed, slantwise, to'ards the sky,
A blazoned eye of bronze: and underneath,
As 'neath two clouds, the lightning and the death
Of the fierce swords played. Now a shield descends—
A long blade leaps;—and now, a fang that rends,
Another blade, loud as a battle word,
Beats downward, trenchant; and, resounding heard,
A shield's fierce face replies: again a sword
Swings for a giant blow, and, balked again,
Burns crashing from a sword. Thus, o'er the plain,
Over and over, blade on baleful blade;
Teeth clenched; and eyes, behind their visors' shade,
Like wild beasts' eyes in caverns; shield to shield,
The champions strove, each scorning still to yield.
Then Arthur drew aside to rest upon
His falchion for a space. But Accolon,
As yet,—through virtue of that magic sheath,—
Fresh and almighty, and no nearer death
Now than when first the fight to death begun,
Chafed at delay. But Arthur, with the sun,
His heavy mail, his wounds, and loss of blood,
Made weary, ceased and for a moment stood
Leaning upon his sword. Then, ""Dost thou tire?""
Sneered Accolon. And then, with fiercer fire,
""Defend thee! yield thee! or die recreant!""
And at the King aimed a wild blow, aslant,
That beat a flying fire from the steel.
Stunned by that blow, the King, with brain a-reel,
Sank on one knee; then rose, infuriate,
Nerved with new vigor; and with heat and hate
Gnarled all his strength into one blow of might,
And in both fists his huge blade knotted tight,
And swung, terrific, for a final stroke,—
And,—as the lightning flames upon an oak,—
Boomed on the burgonet his foeman wore;
Hacked through and through its crest, and cleanly shore,
With hollow clamor, from his head and ears,
The brag and boasting of that griffin fierce:
Then, in an instant, as if made of glass,
That brittle blade burst, shattered; and the grass
Shone, strewn with shards; as 'twere a broken ray,
It fell and bright in feverish fragments lay.
Then groaned the King, disarmed. And straight he knew
This sword was not Excalibur: too true
And perfect tempered, runed and mystical,
That weapon of old wars! and then withal,
Looking upon his foe, who still with stress
Fought on, untiring, and with no distress
Of wounds or heat, he thought, ""I am betrayed!""
Then as the sunlight struck along that blade,
He knew it, by the hilt, for his own brand,
The true Excalibur, that high in hand
Now rose avenging. For Sir Accolon
In madness urged th' unequal battle on
His King defenseless; who, the hilted cross
Of that false weapon grasped, beneath the boss
Of his deep-dented shield crouched; and around,
Like some great beetle, labored o'er the ground,
Whereon the shards of shattered spears and bits
Of shivered steel and gold made sombre fits
Of flame, 'mid which, hard-pressed and cowering
Beneath his shield's defense, the dauntless King
Crawled still defiant. And, devising still
How to secure his sword and by what skill,
Him thus it fortuned when most desperate:
In that close chase they came where, shattered late,
Lay, tossed, the truncheon of a bursten lance,
Which, deftly seized, to Accolon's advance
He wielded with effect. Against the fist
Smote, where the gauntlet clasped the nervous wrist,
That heaved Excalibur for one last blow;
Sudden the palsied sinews of his foe
Relaxed in effort, and, the great sword seized,
Was wrenched away: and straight the wroth King eased
Himself of his huge shield, and hurled it far;
And clasping in both arms of wiry war
His foe, Sir Accolon,—as one hath seen
A strong wind take an ash tree, rocking green,
And swing its sappy bulk, then, trunk and boughs,
Crash down its thundering height in wild carouse
And wrath of tempest,—so King Arthur shook
And headlong flung Sir Accolon. Then took,
Tearing away, that scabbard from his side
And hurled it through the lists, that far and wide
Gulped in the battle breathless. Then, still wroth,
He seized Excalibur; and grasped of both
Wild hands, swung trenchant, and brought glittering down
On rising Accolon. Steel, bone and brawn
That blow hewed through. Unsettled every sense.
Bathed in a world of blood, his limbs lay tense
A moment, then grew limp, relaxed in death.
And bending o'er him, from the brow beneath,
The King unlaced the helm. When dark, uncasqued,
The knight's slow eyelids opened, Arthur asked:
""Say, ere thou diest, whence and who thou art!
What king, what court is thine? And from what part
Of Britain dost thou come? Speak!—for, methinks,
I have beheld thee—where? Some memory links
Me strangely with thy face, thy eyes . . . thou art—
Who art thou?—speak!""—
He answered, slow, then short,
With labored breathing: ""I?—one, Accolon,—
Of Gaul—a knight of Arthur's court—anon—
But to what end—yea, tell me—am I slain?""—
Then bent King Arthur nearer and again
Drew back: then, anguish in his utterance, sighed:
""One of my Table!""—Then asked softly, ""Say,
Whence hadst thou this, my sword? say, in what way
Thou cam'st by it?""—But, wandering, that knight
Heard with dull ears, divining but by sight
The question asked; and answered, ""Woe!—the sword!—
Woe worth the sword!—Lean down!—Canst hear my word?—
From Morgane! Arthur's sister, who had made
Me king of all this kingdom, so she said—
Hadst thou not 'risen, accurséd, like a fate,
To make our schemes miscarry!—Wait! nay, wait!—
A king! dost hear?—a gold and blood-crowned king,
I!—Arthur's sister, queen!—No bird can wing
Higher than her ambition! that resolved
Her brother's death was needed, and evolved
Plots that should ripen with the ripening year,
And here be reaped, perhaps—nay, nay! not here!—
Farewell, my Morgane!—Yea, 'twas she who schemed
While there at Chariot we loved and dreamed
Gone some six months.—There nothing gave us care.
Each morning was a liberal almoner
Prodigal of silver to the earth and air:
Each eve, a fiery dragon, cloud-enrolled,
Convulsive, dying overwhelmed with gold;
On such an eve it was, that, redolent,
She sat by me and said,—'My message sent,
Some night—within the forest—thou, my knight!
Thou and the king!—my men—the forest fight!—
Murder perhaps.—But, well?—who is to blame?' . . .
So with her blood-red thoughts to me she came.
To me! that woman, brighter than a flame,
And wooed my soul to hell, with love accurs'd;
With harlot lips, from which my being first
Drank hell and heaven. She, who was in sooth
My heaven and hell.—But now, behind her youth
She shrivels to a hag!—I see the truth!—
Harlot!—nay, spouse of Urience, King of Gore!—
Wanton!—nay, witch! sweet witch!—what wouldst thou more?—
Hast thou not had thy dream? and wilt thou grieve
That death so ruins it?—Thou dost perceive
How I still love thee! witness bear this field,
This field and he to whom I would not yield!—
Would thou wert here to kiss me ere I die!""—
Then anger in the good King's gloomy eye
Glowed, instant-embered, as one oft may see
A star blaze up in heaven, then cease to be.
Slow from his visage he his visor raised,
And on the dying knight a moment gazed;
Then grimly said, ""Look on me, Accolon!
I am thy King!"" He, with an awful groan,
Blade-battered as he was, beheld and knew;
Strained to his tottering knees; and, gasping, drew
Up full his armored height and hoarsely cried,
""The King!"" and at his mailed feet crashed and died.
Then came a world of anxious faces, pressed
About King Arthur; who, though sore distressed,
Bespake that multitude: ""While breath and power
Remain, judge we these brothers: This hard hour
Hath given to Damas all this rich estate:
So it is his; allotted his by fate
And force of arms. So let it be to him.
For, stood our oath on knighthood not so slim
But that it hath this strong conclusiön.
This much by us as errant knight is done.—
Now our decree, as King of Britain, hear:
We do command Earl Damas to appear
No more upon our shores, or any isles
Of farthest Britain in its many miles.
One week be his, no more! then will we come,
Even with an iron host, to seal his doom:
If he be not departed overseas,
With all his men and all his outlawries,
From his own towers, around which sea-birds clang,
Alive and naked shall he starve and hang
And rot! vile food for kites and carrion crows.
Thus much for him! . . . But all our favor goes
Toward Sir Ontzlake, whom it likes the King
To take into his knightly following
Of the Round Table. Bear to him our word.
But I am over weary. Take my sword.—
Unharness me, for more and more I tire;
And all my wounds are so much aching fire.
Yea; help me hence. To-morrow I would fain
To Glastonbury and with me the slain.""
So bore they then the wounded King away,
The dead behind, as closed the autumn day.
But when, within that abbey, he waxed strong,
The King, remembering the marauder wrong
Which Damas had inflicted on that land,
Commanded Lionell, with a stanch band,
To stamp this weed out if still rooted there.
He, riding thither to that robber lair,
Led Arthur's hopefulest helms, when, thorn on thorn,
Reddened an hundred spears one winter morn:
And found—a ruin of fire-blackened rock,
Of tottering towers, that shook to every shock
Of the wild waves; and loomed above the bents
Turrets and cloudy-clustered battlements,
Wailing with wind that swept those clamorous lands:
Above the foam, that climbed with haling hands,
Desolate and gaunt; reflected in the flats;
Hollow and huge, the haunt of owls and bats.

IV
Hate, born of Wrath and mother red of Crime,
In Hell was whelped ere the hot hands of Time,
Artificer of God, had coined our world
Within the formless void, and round it furled
Its lordly raiment of the day and night,
And germed its womb with beauty and delight:
And Hell sent Hate to Earth, that it might use
And serve Hell's ends, filling with flame its cruse. . . .
For her half-brother Morgane had conceived
Unnatural hatred; so much so, she grieved,
Envious and jealous, for the high renown
And might the King had gathered round his crown
Through truth and honor. And who was it said,
""Those nearest to the crown are those to dread""?—
Warm in your breast a serpent, it will sting
The breast that warms it: and albeit the King
Knew of his sister's hate, he passed it by,
Thinking that love and kindness gradually
Would win her heart to him. He little knew
The witch he dealt with, beautiful to view,
And all the poison she could stoop to brew.
She, who, well knowing how much mightier
The King than Accolon, rejoiced that her
Wits had secured from him Excalibur,
Without which, she was certain, in the joust
The King were as a foe unarmed. Her trust
Smiled, confident of conclusion: eloquent
Within her, whispered of success, that lent
Her heart a lofty hope; and at large eyes
Piled up imperial dreams of power and prize.
And in her carven chamber, oaken-dark,
Traceried and arrased,—when the barren park
Dripped, drenched with autumn,—for November lay
Swathed frostily in fog on every spray,—
She at her tri-arched casement sate one night,
Ere yet came courier from that test of might.
Her lord in slumber and the castle full
Of drowsy silence and the rain's dull lull:
""The King removed?—my soul!—he is removed!
Ere now dog-dead he lies. His sword hath proved
Too much for him. Yet! let him lie in state,
The great king, Arthur!—But, regenerate,
Now crown our other monarch, Accolon!
And, with him, Love, the ermined! balmy son
Of gods, not men; and nobler hence to rule.
Love, Love almighty; beautiful to school
The hearts and souls of mortals!—Then this realm's
Iron-huskéd flower of war,—that overwhelms
The world with havoc,—will explode and bloom
The amaranth, peace, with love for its perfume.
And then, O Launcelots and Tristrams, vowed
To Gueneveres and Isouds,—now allowed
No pleasure but what hour by stolen hour,
In secret places, brings to flaming flower,—
You shall have feasts of passion evermore!
And out-thrust Love, now shivering at the door,
No more shalt stand neglected and cast off,
Insulted and derided; and the scoff
Of War, the bully, whose hands of insult fling
Off, for the iron of arms, thy hands that cling
About his brutal feet, that crush thy face,
Bleeding, into the dust.—Here, in War's place,
We will erect a shrine of sacrifice;
Love's sacrifice; a shrine of purest price;
Where each shall lay his heart and each his soul
For Love, for earthly Love! who shall control
The world, and make it as the Heaven whole;
Being to it its stars and moon and sun,
Its firmament and all its lights in one.
And if by such Love Heaven should be debarred,
Its God, its spheres, with spiritual love instarred,
Hell will be Heaven, our Heaven, while Love shall thus
Remain earth Love, that God encouraged in us.
""And now for Urience, my gaunt old lord!—
There lies my worry.—Yet, hath he no sword
No dangerous dagger I, hid softly here,
Sharp as an adder's fang? or for his ear
No instant poison to insinuate
Ice in his pulses, and with death abate?""
So did she then determine; on that night
Of lonely autumn, when no haggard, white,
Wan, watery moon dreamed on the streaming pane;
But, on the leads, beat the incessant rain,
And the lamenting wind wailed wild among
The trees and turrets, like a phantom throng.
So grew her face severe as skies that take
Suggestions of far storm whose thunders shake
The distant hills with wrath, and cleave with fire
A pine the moaning forest mourns as sire—
So touched her countenance that dark intent:
And in still eyes her thoughts were evident,
As in dark waters, luminous and deep,
The heavens glass themselves when o'er them sweep
The clouds of storm and austere stars they keep,—
Ghostly and gray,—locked in their steadfast gloom.
Then, as if some great wind had swept the room,
Silent, intense, she rose up from her seat.
As if dim arms had made her a retreat,
Secret as thought to move in, like a ghost,
Noiseless as sleep and subtle as the frost,
Poised like a light and borne as carefully,
She trod the gusty hall where shadowy
The hangings rolled a dim Pendragon war.
And there the mail of Urience shone. A star,
Glimmering above, a dying cresset dropped
From the stone vault and flared. And here she stopped,
And took the sword, fresh-burnished by his page,
Long as a flame of pale, arrested rage.—
For she had thought that, when they found him dead,
His sword laid by him on the bloody bed
Would be convictive that his own hand had
Done him this violence when fever-mad.
The sword she took; and to the chamber, where
King Urience slept, she glided; like an air,
Smooth in seductive sendal; or a fit
Of faery song, a wicked charm in it,
That slays; an incantation full of guile.
She paused upon his threshold; for a while
Listened; and, sure he slept, stole in and stood
Crouched o'er his couch. About her heart the blood
Caught, strangling; then rose throbbing, thud on thud,
Up to her wide-stretched eyes, and up and up,
As wine might, whirling wildly in a cup.
Then came rare Recollection, with a mouth.
Sweet as the honeyed sunbeams of the South
Trickling through perplexed ripples of the leaves;
To whose faint form a veil of starshine cleaves
Intricate gauze from memoried eyes to feet—
Feet softer than the sifted snows and fleet
To come and go and airy anxiously.
She, trembling to her, like a flower a bee
Nests in and makes an audible mouth of musk,
Lisping a downy message to the dusk,
Laid lips to ears and languaged memories of
Now hateful Urience:—How her maiden love
Had left Caerleon secretly for Gore,
With him, one day of autumn. How a boar,
Wild as the wildness of the solitude,
Raged at her from a cavern of the wood,
That, crimson-creepered, yawning the bristling curse,
Murderous upon her. As her steed grew worse
And, terrified, fled snorting down the dell,
How she had flung herself from out the selle,
In fear, upon a bank of springly moss,
Where she lay swooning: in an utter loss
Of mind and limbs; wherein she seemed to see,
Or saw in horror, half unconsciously,—
As one who pants beneath an incubus
And strives to shriek or move, delirious,—
The monster-thing thrust tow'rds her, tusked and fanged,
And hideous snouted: how the whole wood clanged
And buzzed and boomed a hundred sounds and lights
Lawless about her brain,—like leaves wild nights
Of hurrican harvest, shouting.—Then it seemed
A fury thundered 'twixt them — and she screamed
As round her flew th' uprooted loam that held
Leaves, twigs and matted moss; and, clanging, swelled
Continual echoes with the thud of strife,
And groan of man and brute that warred for life:
How all the air, gone mad with foam and forms,
Spun froth and, 'twixt her, wrestled hair and arms,
And hoofs and feet that crushed the leaves and shred,
Whirling them wildly, brown, and yellow, and red.
And how she rose and leaned her throbbing head,
With all its uncoifed braids of raven hair
Disheveled, on one arm,—as white and fair
And smooth as milk,—and saw, as through a haze,
The brute thing throttled and the frowning face
Of Urience bent above it, browed with might;
One red swol'n arm, that pinned the hairy fright,
Strong as a god's, iron at the gullet's brawn:
Dug in its midriff, the close knees, updrawn,
Wedged, as with steel, the glutton sides that strove,—
A shaggy bulk,—with hoofs that drove and drove.
And then she saw how Urience swiftly slipped
One arm, the monster's tearing tusks had ripped
And ribboned redly, to the dagger's hilt,—
Which at his hip hung long, its haft gold-gilt;—
Flame-like it flashed; and then, as bright as ice,
Plunged, and replunged; again, now twice, now thrice;
And the huge boar, stretched out in sullen death,
Lay, bubbling blood, with harsh, laborious breath.
Then how he brought her water from a well,
That rustled freshly near them as it fell
Form its full-manteled urn, in his deep casque,
And begged her drink; then bathed her brow, a task
That had accompanying tears of joy and vows
Of love, and intercourse of eyes and brows,
And many kisses: then, beneath the boughs,
His wound dressed, and her steed still violent
From fear, she mounted and behind him bent
And clasped him on the same steed; and they went
On through the gold wood tow'rds the golden west,
Till, on one low hill's forest-covered crest,
Gray from the gold, his castle's battlements pressed.
And then she felt she'd love him till had come
Fame of the love of Isoud, whom, from home,
Tristram had brought across the Irish foam;
And Guenevere's for Launcelot of the Lake:
Then how her thought from these did seem to take
Reflex of longing; and within her wake
Desire for some great lover who should slake;
And such found Accolon.
And then she thought
How far she'd fallen, and how darkly fraught
With consequence was this. Then what distress
Were hers and his — her lover's—and success
How doubly difficult if, Arthur slain,
King Urience lived to assert his right to reign.
So she stood pondering with the sword; her lips
Breathless, and tight as were her finger-tips
About the weapon's hilt. And so she sighed,
""Nay, nay! too long hast lived who shouldst have died
Even in the womb, my sorrow! who for years
Hast leashed my life to thine, a bond of tears,
A weight of care, a knot that thus I part!
Thus harshly sever! Ugly that thou art
Into the elements naked!""
O'er his heart
The long blade paused and—then descended hard.
Unfleshed, she flung it by her murdered lord,
And watched the blood spread darkly through the sheet,
And drip, a horror, at impassive feet
Pooling the polishedolished oak. Regretless she
Stood, and relentless; in her ecstasy
A lovely devil: demon crowned, that cried
For Accolon, with passion that defied
Control in all her senses; clamorous as
A torrent in a cavernous mountain pass
That sweeps to wreck and ruin; at that hour
So swept her longing tow'rds her paramour.
Him whom, King Arthur had commanded when
Borne from the lists, she should receive again;
Her lover, her dear Accolon, as was just,
As was but due her for her love—and lust.
And while she stood revolving if her deed's
Secret were safe, behold! a noise of steeds,
Arms, jingling, stirrups, voices loud that cursed
Fierce in the northern court. To her, athirst
For him her lover, war and power it spoke,
Him victor and so king. And then awoke
Desire to see and greet him: and she fled,
Like some wild spectre, down the stairs; and, red,
Burst on a glare of links and glittering mail,
That shrunk her eyes and made her senses quail.
To her a bulk of iron, bearded fierce,
Down from a steaming steed into her ears,
""This from the King, O Queen!"" laughed harsh and hoarse:
Two henchmen beckoned, who pitched sheer, with force,
Loud clanging at her feet, hacked, hewn, and red,
Crusted with blood, a knight in armor—dead:
Her Accolon, flung in his battered arms
By what to her seemed fiends and demon forms,
Wild-torched, who mocked; then, with the parting scoff,
""This from the King!"" phantoms in fog, rode off.
And what remains?—From Camelot to Gore
That night she, wailing, fled; thence, to the shore,—
As old romances tell,—of Avalon;
Where she hath majesty gold-crowned and wan:
Clothed dark in cypress, still her lovely face
Is young and queenly; sweeter though in grace,
And softer for the sorrow there; the trace
Of immemorial tears as for some crime,
Attempted or committed at some time,
Some old, unhappy time of long ago,
That haunts her eyes and fills them with its woe:
Sad eyes, dark, future-fixed, expectant of
That far-off hour awaited of her love,
When the forgiving Arthur cometh and
Shall rule, dim King, o'er all that golden land,
That Isle of Avalon, where none grows old,
Where spring is ever, and never a wind blows cold;
That lifts its mountains from forgotten seas
Of surgeless turquoise deep with mysteries.—
And so was seen Morgana nevermore,
Save once, when from the Cornwall coast she bore
The wounded Arthur from that last fought fight
Of Camlan in a black barge into the night.
But some may see her, with palfried band
Of serge-stoled maidens, through the drowsy land
Of autumn glimmer,—when are sadly strewn
The red leaves, and, broad in the east, the moon
Hangs, full of frost, a lustrous globe of gleams,—
Faint on the mooning hills as shapes in dreams."

You might want to sing it note for note
Don't worry, be happy
In every life we have some trouble
But when you worry you make it double
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy now

Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy

Don't worry, be happy

Ain't got no place to lay your head
Somebody came and took your bed

Don't worry, be happy (Look at me, I'm happy)

Don't worry, be happy
(Hey I'll give you my phone number, when you worry call me I'll make you happy!)
Don't worry, be happy

Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
Ain't got no gal to make you smile
But don't worry, be happy
'Cause when you worry your face will frown
And that will bring everybody down
So don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy now

Don't worry, be happy

Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy

Now there is the song I wrote
I hope you learned it note for note, like good little children
Don't worry, be happy
Now listen to what I said, in your life expect some trouble

Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
(Bad medicine)

I ain't got a fever got a permanent disease
It'll take more than a doctor to prescribe a remedy
I got lots of money but it isn't what I need
Gonna take more than a shot to get this poison out of me
And I got all the symptoms count them, one, two, three

First you need, that's what you get for falling in love
Then you bleed, you get a little but it's never enough
On your knees, that's what you get for falling in love
And now this boy's addicted cause your kiss is the drug

Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
(Bad, bad medicine)

I don't need no needle to be giving me a thrill
And I don't need no anesthesia or a nurse to bring a pill
I got a dirty down addiction, it doesn't leave a track
I got a jolt for your affection like a monkey on my back
There ain't no paramedic gonna save this heart attack

When you need, that's what you get for falling in love
Then you bleed, you get a little but it's never enough
On your knees, that's what you get for falling in love
Now I'm addicted and your kiss is the drug

Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
So let's play doctor, baby, cure my disease
(Bad, bad medicine) That's what I want
(Bad, bad medicine) That's what I need

I need a respirator cause I'm running out of breath
You're an all night generator wrapped is stockings and a dress
When you find your medicine you take what you can get
'Cause if there's something better baby well they haven't found it yet

Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
Bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
Your love's the potion that can cure my disease

Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name

The passion's so complete
It's never ending
As long as I receive
This message you're sending

Body to body, soul to soul
Always feel you near
So say the words I long to hear

Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name

Love, love on the run
Breaking us down
Though we keep holding on
I don't want to lose
No, I can't let you go

Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name

Tell it to my heart
Tell me from the stars
Tell it to my heart
Tell it to my heart
Tell me from the stars
Tell it to my heart
Never make it stop
Oh take it to the heart
Oh no no ah ah

Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name

Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name"

Why do I feel this way
Why does she stay on my mind
If it isn't love
Why does it hurt so bad
Make me feel so sad inside
If it isn't love
I told her I'd never fall in love
But now I know better

How does it feel
I can't describe this feeling
That came when I saw her last night
She got to me
I'll let you know the reason
I saw her with another guy
So...

Why does she stay on my mind
And if it isn't love
Why does it hurt so bad
Make me feel so sad inside
If it isn't love

Maybe she'll take me back
(Hey, girl, he's begging)
I made a big mistake
(Won't you forgive him, girl)
Now I can feel it
(He's never felt before)
I really love her
(You love her?!?! What?!?!)

It took my heart
To shatter in a thousand pieces
Before I'd ever drop my pride
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Losing love worrying about my image
Really helped me realize

If it isn't love
Why do I feel this way
(Why does it hurt so bad?)
Why does she stay on my mind
(On my mind all the time)
If it isn't love
Why does it hurt so bad
(If it isn't love)
Make me feel so sad inside
(If it isn't love)
If it isn't love
If it isn't love
Why do I feel this way
Why does she stay on my mind
(She stays on my mind, mind, mind)
If it isn't love
Why does it hurt so bad
(Why does it hurt so bad?)
Make me feel so sad inside
If it isn't love

Why do I feel this way
(If it isn't love)
Why does she stay on my mind

Just can't get into second gear
Or when your kitchen sink
Is shooting water in your ear

I have told you this before
Is there a special reason
That you just can't understand
I'm not the one to call
When you need a heavy man
Unless whatever needs fixing, girl
Is you
And I just have to say


Don't call me
When your toaster won't pop up
Don't call me
Just to cut your lawn
Don't call me
When your radio cuts off
In the middle of your favorite song
Don't call me when your shower just went
Uh-uh, no, baby
Don't call me

And it seems to me you lived your life

Never knowing who to cling to

But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
And even when you died
Oh, the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in

From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in

Want to be mine

I get the feeling I've never been here before
Because no one I've known's ever moved me the way
That you do
And I know this is the real thing
It's all I've been searching for
I've put it all on the line now I'm hoping you feel
That way too
(And if you do) Why don't you...

Say you will, say you won't
Make up your mind tonight
Say you do, say you don't
Want to be mine
Now will you, say you will, you say you won't
Make up your mind this time
Say you will, say you will
You'll be mine tonight

Will you tell me how much I mean to you
Will you say you always will be true
I need more than a come-on sign
So won't you say you will be mine

Now won't you, say you will, say you won't
Make up your mind tonight
Say you will, say you will
Be my guiding light
Say you will, say you won't
Make up your mind tonight
Say you do, say you don't
Want to be mine

Come on come on
Say you will make up your mind tonight
Say you will, say you will
Be mine tonight"

Baby I'll spill the facts

Honey, I just wonder what you do
There in the back of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac
Well, now way back in the Bible
Temptations always come along
There's always somebody tempting you
Somebody into doing something they know is wrong
Well, they tempt you, man, with silver
And they tempt you, sir, with gold
And they tempt you with the pleasures
That flesh does surely hold
They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple
Man, I ain't going for that
I know it was her pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls, peeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey, I just wonder what you're doing
In the back of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac
Now, now, now, some folks say it's too big
And uses too much gas
Some folks say that it's too old
And that it just goes too fast
Oh, but love is bigger than a Honda (Honda)
And it's bigger than a Subaru (that too)
Hey man there's only one thing
And one car that will do
Anyway we don't have to drive it
Honey, we can park it out in back
And have a party in your pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls, peeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey, I just wonder what you do there
In the back of your pink Cadillac
You know the one I mean, Le Car

I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me myself, I got nothing to prove

You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us outta here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living

See my old man's got a problem
He lives with a bottle that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
When momma went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
Said somebody's gotta take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or, live and die this way

So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights, lay out before us
And your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulder and
I-I had a feeling that I belonged
I-I had a feeling I, could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
We go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights, lay out before us
And your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulder and
I-I had a feeling that I belonged
I-I had a feeling I, could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
I've got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bars
See more your friends than you do your kids
I always hoped for better
That maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving

So remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights, lay out before us
And your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulder and
I-I had a feeling that I belonged
I-I had a feeling I, could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so you can fly away?
You gotta make a decision

This time I'll go where she wants me to go
She said maybe today, maybe tomorrow
Deep in the woods down the low valley road
While no one was lookin' on the old plantation
He took her all the way down the long valley road
They sent her away not too much later
And left him walking down the old valley road
Walk on
Walk on, walk on alone
Walk on, walk on
Walk on alone, alone
Out in the hall, they were talking in a whisper
Everybody noticed she was gone awhile
Somebody said she's gone to her sister's
Everybody knew what they were talking about
Whoa, while no one was lookin' on the old plantation
He showed her what they do down the long valley road
She came back around like nothing really happened
And left him standing on the old valley road
Walk on
Walk on, walk on alone
Walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk on, on the valley road
Standing like a stone on the old plantation

Good enough to hire, not good enough to marry
When it all happens, nobody wins
Walk on

Is that I'm down for you and treat you right

Uh no, oh oh, no
Don't be cruel
Girl, you need to change your attitude
Uh no, oh, uh don't be cruel

Hey, yo, cutie what's up with this attitude?
I thought I was being real good to you
I treat you sweet, take you out at night
But you never say thanks, girl, that ain't right
I bought you diamonds even gave you pearls
I took you for a cruise all around the world
I treat you high-post but you play me close
And if I put a drink up, you won't even toast
Girl, I work so hard for you from nine to five
So you could have the finer things in life
Since you're the kind that's never satisfied

Oh-oh-oh, girl, as long as I've been giving my heart to you
You should be giving me your heart too, oh
But you just keep on acting just like a fool
You know it ain't cool


From fancy cars to diamond rings
I've just about given you everything
There's really not much I won't do for you
I bought you twelve yellow roses and candy too
I like to be up front and never play the back
But the way you treat me girl is like a heart attack
I'm a real troop trooper aiming for the top
And with you by my side, d-dollars I will clock

Oh-oh-oh, girl, as long as I've been giving my love to you
You should be giving me your love too, oh
But you just keep on acting just like a fool
You know it ain't cool
It just ain't cool (Hoo)
Don't be cruel
I know, oh

We used to hang out tough, just kicking around
We discovered a love that had never been found
You gave me your heart, I gave you my mind
But a true love affair we could never find
Although I want you bad I could let you go
'Cause there's a lot of girls out there that won't say no
Lo to the fact that I want you, Jackie
I want you more than human eyes can see
But you had to start illin', trying to make a killin'
Thought about the dollars I make and you were willing
To be with me, Bobby B
But with a bad attitude I can't compete
Now you know my name, now I know your game
You want to be with me you got to be the same way
That another girl would be, and if you wanna be with me"

To have a second chance

Never has to end
Then we must know that we will love again

Wondering if your love was really mine

Although we both lie close together we feel miles apart inside
Was it something I said or something I did?
Did my words not come out right?
Though I tried not to hurt you
Though I tried
But I guess that's why they say

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad sad song
Every rose has its thorn
Yeah it does

I listen to our favorite song playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say love's a game of easy come and easy go
But I wonder does he know
Has he ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could have let you know somehow
I guess

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad sad song
Every rose has its thorn

Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains

I know I could have saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love
We both made our separate ways

And now I hear you found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife
I guess

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad sad song
Every rose has its thorn"

It must have been cold there in my shadow
To never have sunlight on your face
You were content to let me shine, that's your way
You always walked a step behind

So I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one with all the strength
A beautiful face without a name for so long
A beautiful smile to hide the pain

Did you ever know that you're my hero
And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings

It might have appeared to go unnoticed
But I've got it all here in my heart
I want you to know, I know the truth, of course I know it
I would be nothing without you

Did you ever know that you're my hero?
You're everything I wish I could be
I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
Did I ever tell you you're my hero?
You're everything, everything I wish I could be
Oh, and I, I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
Cause you are the wind beneath my wings

Oh, the wind beneath my wings
You, you, you, you are the wind beneath my wings
Fly, fly, fly away, you let me fly so high

Is like trying to catch a star
So many people love you, baby
That must be what you are

Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms
Baby, yeah
Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms
Baby, yeah

I've learn to feel what I cannot see
But with you, I lose that vision
I don't know how to dream your dream
So I'm all caught up in the superstition
I want to reach out and pull you to me
Who says I should let a wild one go free

Trying to catch your heart
Is like trying to catch a star
But I can't love you this much, baby
And love you from this far

Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms
Baby, yeah
Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms
Baby, yeah

Waiting (however long)
I don't like waiting (I'll wait for you)
It's so hard waiting (Don't be too long)
Seems like waiting
Makes me love you even more

Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms
Baby, yeah
Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms
Baby, yeah"

If salvation is worlds away

All the love I feel for you
Nothing could make me change my point of view

I got thoughts, can't control
Got me down, got me low
Rest my mind, rest my soul
When I blow, when I blow
Am I wrong, let them know
Feels so right to let things go
Don't think twice, this is me
This is how I should be

But I'm aggravated without it
My saddest days are without it
My Saturdays are the loudest
I'm blowing strong
Some niggas graduated to powder
I dabble later, I doubt it
My database of narcotics
It's growing long
But I'm aggravated without it
My saddest days are without it
My Saturdays are the loudest

Some niggas graduated to powder
I dabble later, I doubt it
My database of narcotics
It's growing long

I wrote this shit to talk about the word addiction
To my niggas --- I hope you listening
--- and ---, I hope you listening
This is for the whole fucking Ville, I hope you're listening
Smoking medical grade, but I ain't got prescription
All the way in Cali where they ain't got precipi-
-tation, feeling like the only one that made it
And I hate it for my niggas 'cause they ain't got ambition
Fuck did you expect, you can blame it on condition
Blame it on crack, you can blame it on the system
Blame it on the fact that 12 got jurisdiction
To ride around in neighborhoods that they ain't ever lived in
Blame it on the strain that you feel when daddy missing
Blame it on Trump shit, blame it on Clinton
Blame it on trap music and the politicians
Or the fact that every black boy wanna be Pippen
But they only got 12 slots on the Pistons
Blame it on the rain, Milli Vanilli with the disk skip
What I'm tryna say is the blame can go deep as seas
Just to blame 'em all I would need like twenty CD's
There's all sorts of trauma from drama that children see
Type of shit that normally would call for therapy
But you know just how it go in our community
Keep that shit inside it don't matter how hard it be
Fast forward, them kids is grown and they blowing trees
And popping pills due to chronic anxiety
I been saw the problem but stay silent 'cause I ain't Jesus
This ain't no trial if you desire go higher please
But fuck that now I'm older I love you 'cause you my friend
Without the drugs I want you be comfortable in your skin
I know you so I know you still keep a lot of shit in
You running from yourself and you buying product again
I know you say it helps and no I'm not trying to offend
But I know depression and drug addiction don't blend
Reality distorts and then you get lost in the wind
And I done seen the combo take niggas off the deep end
One thing about your demons they bound to catch up one day
I'd rather see you stand up and face them than run away
I understand this message is not the coolest to say
But if you down to try it I know of a better way
Meditate

Meditate, meditate, meditate, meditate
Don't medicate, medicate, don't medicate, medicate
Meditate, meditate, meditate, meditate
Don't medicate, medicate, don't medicate, medicate

I got thoughts, can't control
Got me down, got me low
Rest my mind, rest my soul
When I blow, when I blow
Am I wrong, let them know
Feels so right to let things go
Don't think twice, this is me
This is how I should be

I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
You've built a love but that love falls apart
Your little piece of Heaven turns too dark

Listen to your heart when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye

Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile
The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yeah
They're swept away and nothing is what is seems
The feeling of belonging to your dreams

Listen to your heart when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye


And there are voices that want to be heard
So much to mention but you can't find the words
The scent of magic, the beauty that's been
When love was wilder than the wind

Listen to your heart when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart before
Listen to your heart when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye

Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart"

Give me reasons at all

When all faith is gone
I fight myself to carry on
Yet, I know of the harm I do

I can't help
What I feel inside
What more can I say?

Right for you
I'll make that move
And when I do
Will I doubt again the way I do?

Blames the one before
And all of their frustrations
Come beating on your door
I know that I'm a prisoner to all my father held so dear
I know that I'm a hostage, to all his hopes and fears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years
Crumpled bits of paper
Filled with imperfect thought
Stilted conversations
I'm afraid that's all we've got
You say you just don't see it
He says it's perfect sense
You just can't get agreement
In this present tense
We all talk a different language
Talking in defence

Say it loud, say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die
To admit we don't see eye to eye
So we open up a quarrel
Between the present and the past
We only sacrifice the future
It's the bitterness that lasts
So don't yield to the fortunes
You sometimes see as fate
It may have a new perspective
On a different day
And if you don't give up, and don't give in
You may just be OK

I wasn't there that morning
When my father passed away
I didn't get to tell him
All the things I had to say
I think I caught his spirit
Later that same year
I'm sure I heard his echo
In my baby's new born tears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years"

Workin' all week 9 to 5 for my money
So when the weekend comes I go get live with the honey
Rollin' down the street I saw this girl and she was pumpin'
I winked my eye she got into the ride went to a club was jumpin'
Introduce myself as Loc she said ""You're a liar""
I said ""I got it goin' on baby doll and I'm on fire""
Took her to the hotel she said ""You're the king""
I said ""Be my queen if you know what I mean and let us do the wild thing

Wild thing
Wild thing

Shoppin' at the mall looking for some gear to buy
I saw this girl she cool rocked my world and I had to adjust my fly
She looked at me and smiled and said ""You have plans for the night?""
I said ""Hopefully if things go well I'll be with you tonight""
So we journeyed to her house one thing led to another
I keyed the door we cold hit the floor looked up and it was her mother
I didn't know what to say I was hanging by a string
She said ""Hey you two I was once like you and I liked to do the wild thing""

Wild thing
She loved to do the wild thing
Wild thing
Please baby baby please

Posse in effect hangin' out is always hype
And when me and the crew leave the shindig I want a girl who's just my type
Saw this luscious little frame I ain't lyin' fellas she was fine
The sweet young miss go gave me a kiss and I knew that she was mine
Took her to the limousine still parked outside
I tipped the chauffeur when it was over and I gave her my own ride
Couldn't get her off my jock she was like static cling
But that's what happens when body start slappin' from doin' the wild thing

Wild thing
She wanna do the wild thing
Please baby baby please
Wild thing

Doin' a little show at the local discotheque
This fine young chick was on my jock so I say what the heck
She want to come on stage and do her little dance
So I said chill for now but maybe later you'll get your chance
So when the show was finished I took her around the way
And what do you know she was good to go without a word to say
We was all alone and she said ""Tone let me tell you one thing
I need $50 to make you holler I get paid to do the wild thing""

Say what
Yo love you must be kidding
You're walkin' babe
Just break out of here
Hasta la vista baby

With his hands in his pockets and his crocodile feet?
Hanging off the curb, looking all disturbed
And the boys from home, they all came running
They were making noise, manhandling toys
There's the girls on the block with the nasty curls
Wearing padded bras sucking beers through straws
Dropping down their drawers, where did you get yours?

When your shoes worn through and there's a rumble in your tummy
But you had to have style get a gold tooth smile
Put a girl on the corner so you can make a pile
Committed a crime and went inside
It was coming your way but you had to survive

Looking good in a Buffalo Stance
Looking good when it comes to the crunch

This here's a jam for all the fellas
Tryin' to do what those ladies tell us
Get shot down cause ya overzealous
Play hard to get females get jealous
Okay smarty, go to a party
Girls are scantily clad and showin' body
A chick walks by you wish you could sex her
But you're standing on the wall like you was Poindexter
Next day's function, high class luncheon
Food is served and you're stone-cold munchin'
Music comes on people start to dance
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants
A girl starts walking, guys start gawking
Sits down next to you and starts talking
Says she wants to dance cause she likes to groove
So come on fatso and just bust a move
Just bust a move
Just bust a move
Just bust a move

You're on a mission and you're wishin'
Someone could cure your lonely condition
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
No fine girls just ugly faces
From frustration, first inclination
Is to become a monk and leave the situation
But every dark tunnel has a light of hope
So don't hang yourself, with a celibate rope
New movie's showin', so you're goin'
Could care less about the five you're blowin'
Theater gets dark just to start the show
Then ya spot a fine woman sittin' in your row
She's dressed in yellow, she says ""Hello
Come sit next to me you fine fellow""
You run over there without a second to lose
And what comes next? Hey, bust a move

You want it
You got it
You want it
Baby you got it (Just bust a move)
You want it
You got it
You want it
Baby you got it, yeah

In the city, ladies look pretty
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty
Tell a funny joke just to get some play
Then you try to make a move and she says, ""No way""
Girls are fakin', goodness sakin'
They want a man who brings home the bacon
Got no money and you got no car
Then you got no woman and there you are
Some girls are sadistic, materialistic
Lookin' for a man makes them opportunistic
They're lyin' on the beach perpetrating a tan
So that a brother with money can be their man
So on the beach you're strollin', real high rollin'
Everything you have is yours and not stolen
A girl runs up with somethin' to prove
So don't just stand there, bust a move

You want it
You got it
You want it
Baby you got it (Just bust a move)
You want it
You got it
You want it
Baby you got it

Break it down for me fellas

Your best friend Harry, has a brother Larry
In five days from now he's gonna marry
He's hopin' you can make it there if you can
Cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man
You say, ""neat-o"", check your libido
And roll to the church in your new tuxedo
The bride walks down just to start the wedding
And there's one more girl you won't be getting
So you start thinkin' then you start blinking
A bridesmaid looks and thinks that you're winking
She thinks you're kinda cute so she winks back
And now your feelin' really firm cause the girl is stacked
Reception's jumpin', faces pumpin'
Look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin'
Says she wanna dance to a different groove
Now you know what to do, so you bust a move

You want it
You got it
You want it
Baby you got it (Just bust a move)
You want it
You got it
You want it
Baby you got it (move it boy)

I'm a humming and a strumming all over god's world
You can't remember when you got your last meal
And you don't know just how a woman feels
You didn't know what rock and roll was
Until you met my drummer on a grey tour bus
I got there in the nick of time
Before he got his hands across your state line
Now it's the middle of the night on the open road
And the heater don't work and it's oh so cold
You're looking tired, you're looking kind of beat
The rhythm of the street sure knocks you off your feet
You didn't know how rock and roll looked
Until you caught your sister with the guys from the group
Half way home in the parking lot
By the look in her eye she was giving what she got
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
Woman you're a mess going to die in your sleep
There's blood on my amp and my Les Paul's beat
Can't keep you home, you're messing around
My best friend told me you're the best lick in town
You didn't know that rock and roll burned
So you bought a candle and you lived and you learned
You got the rhythm you got the speed
Mama's little baby likes it short and sweet
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
I didn't know you had a rock and roll record
Until i saw your picture on another guy's jacket
You told me I was the only one
But look at you now, it's dark and you're gone
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby

But when I get your call, I'm all choked up
Can't believe you called my home
And as a matter of fact, it blows my mind
You would even talk to me
Because a girl like you is like a dream come true

Everybody out there don't talk less about me
Cause I'm rocking it steady

With a heart made of stone
I got a restless spirit
That nobody can own
If a picture tells a story
Won't you listen to mine
I'm searching for the answer
But it's so hard to find
You'll see much deeper
When you read between the lines
'Cause there's a fire
Burning in my eyes
Like a thief in the night
Who can't get enough
I am willing to fight
'Cause I'm a soldier of love
Like a shot in the dark
When the goin' gets rough
It's a state of the heart
When you're a soldier of love
I willing to fight
Love can be so heartless
When you turn out the lights
A mutual surrender
In the heat of the night
Life's an empty picture
When you're living alone
Maybe that's the reason
Every heart needs a home
Each time I fall down
I get on my feet again
I'm gonna win this battle
In the end
Like a thief in the night
Who can't get enough
I am willing to fight
'Cause I'm a soldier of love
Like a shot in the dark
When the goin' gets rough
It's a state of the heart
When you're a soldier of love
You'll see much deeper
When you read between the lines
Cause there's a fire
Burning in my eyes
Like a thief in the night
Who can't get enough
I am willing to fight
'Cause I'm a soldier of love
Like a shot in the dark
When the goin' gets rough
It's a state of the heart
When you're a soldier of love
Shalalalalala, when the goin' gets rough
Shalalalalala, I'm a soldier of love
Shalalalalala, when the goin' gets rough
Shalalalalala, a soldier for your love
Like a thief in the night
Who can't get enough
I am willing to fight
'Cause I'm a soldier of love
Like a shot in the dark
When the goin' gets rough
It's a state of the heart
When you're a soldier of love"

Cold coolin at a bar, and I'm lookin for some action
But like Mick Jagger said, I can't get no satisfaction
The girls are all around, but none of them wanna get with me
My threads are fresh and I'm lookin def, yo, what's up with L-o-c?
The girls is all jockin at the other end of the bar
Havin drinks with some no-name chump, when they know that I'm the star
So I got up and strolled over to the other side of the cantina
I asked the guy, ""Why you so fly?"" he said, ""Funky Cold Medina""
Funky Cold Medina

This brother told me a secret on how to get more chicks
Put a little Medina in your glass, and the girls'll come real quick
It's better than any alcohol or aphrodisiac
A couple of sips of this love potion, and she'll be on your lap
So I gave some to my dog when he began to beg
Then he licked his bowl and he looked at me and did the wild thing on my leg
He used to scratch and bite me, before he was much much meaner
But now all the poodles run to my house for the Funky Cold Medina
You know what I'm sayin?
I got every dog in my neighborhood breakin down my door
I got Spuds McKenzie
Alex from Stroh's
They won't leave my dog alone with that Medina, pal

I went up to this girl, she said, ""Hi, my name is Sheena""
I thought she'd be good to go with a little Funky Cold Medina
She said, ""I'd like a drink,"" I said, ""Ehm - ok, I'll go get it""
Then a couple sips she cold licked her lips, and I knew that she was with it
So I took her to my crib, and everything went well as planned
But when she got undressed, it was a big old mess, Sheena was a man
So I threw him out, I don't fool around with no Oscar Meyer wiener
You must be sure that the girl is pure for the Funky Cold Medina
You know, ain't no plans with a man
This is the 80's, and I'm down with the ladies, ya know?
Break it down

Back in the saddle, lookin for a little affection
I took a shot as a contestant on ""The Love Connection""
The audience voted, and you know they picked a winner
I took my date to the Hilton for Medina and some dinner
She had a few drinks, I'm thinkin soon what I'll be gettin
Instead she started talkin 'bout plans for our wedding
I said, ""Wait, slow down, love, not so fast says, I'll be seein' ya""
That's why I found you don't play around with the Funky Cold Medina
Ya know what I'm sayin
That Medina's a monster, y'all

Ohhh ah, I wanna hear you scream

Welcome to the jungle, it gets worse here everyday
You learn to live like an animal in the jungle where we play
If you got a hunger for what you see, you'll take it eventually
You can have anything you want, but you better not take it from me

In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your shun n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n knees, knees
Uh oh, I'm gonna watch you bleed

And when you're high, you never
Ever want to come down
So down, so down, so down, yeah!


You know where you are?
You're in the jungle, baby
You're gonna die

In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your shun n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n knees, knees
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my, my serpentine

Watch it bring you to your shun n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n knees, knees

In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your, it's going to bring you down, huh"

And taste the blood from my blade
And when we sleep, would you shelter me in
Your warm and darkened grave?

Will you ever take me? No, I just can't take the pain
Would you ever trust me? No, I'll never feel the same

Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you — a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?

You've been hit by—
You've been struck by—
A Smooth Criminal

Okay, I want everybody to clear the area right now!

Will you tell us that you're okay? (I don't know)
There's a sound at the window (I don't know)
Then he struck you, a crescendo Annie? (I don't know)
He came into your apartment (I don't know)

And then you ran into the bedroom (Help me)
You were struck down

I can still remember
They call me to tell me
You went away
It was such a cold day

On a Sunday morning
It came without a warning
And all the pain I felt inside
I just can't forget you
I'm feeling so alone
Though many times I've tried
I can't get you off my mind

I'm thinking of you
Wonder where you are tonight
I wish that I could hold you tight
I'm thinking of you
Wish you could stay
But you're so far away
So far away

And even though you're gone
I know you're happy where you are
I know someday
We'll be together together again



I know someday I'll hold you again
You and me together again
But until that day
I'm thinking of you"

And rolled beneath a deep blue sky
Didn't have a care in the world
With mommy and daddy standin' by
But ""happily ever after"" fails
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers dwell on small details
Since daddy had to fly
Oh, but I know a place where we can go
Still untouched by men
Sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass waves in the wind
You can lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence
O' beautiful, for spacious skies
But now those skies are threatening
They're beating plowshares into swords
For this tired old man that we elected king
Armchair warriors often fail
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers clean up all details
Since daddy had to lie
Oh, but I know a place where we can go
And wash away this sin
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass waves in the wind
Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair spill all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence

Who knows how long this will last
Now we've come so far, so fast
But, somewhere back there in the dust
That same small town in each of us
I need to remember this
So baby give me just one kiss
And let me take a long last look
Before we say goodbye
Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence
Oh nah nah
Naaah"
