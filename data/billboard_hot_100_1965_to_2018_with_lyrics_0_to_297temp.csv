The good thing I found don't let me down
Baby say that you'd be staying
Cause I couldn't face the day if you weren't here by my side
And if you went away then I'd be left without any pride
I've given up on schemes cause everyone fell through
I've given up so many things don't ask me to give up on you
And baby, baby just once in my life
I'm gonna get what I want girl don't let me down
Just once in my life
Let me hold on to the good thing I found don't let me down
Baby say that you'd be staying
That old pot of gold ain't so easy to find
But if you'll stand by me
Girl I'll keep peace of mind
I can't give you the world
But I'll work hard for you girl
I'll work hard, everyday, all my life
If you'll say you won't leave me
Baby don't leave me
Please don't leave me
Baby don't leave me
Just do this for me baby
Once in my life, let me get what I want
Girl don't let me down;
Just once in my life, let me hold onto a good thing I've found, don't
Let me down
Baby say that you'll be stayin' Mmmm
Oh yeah, Mmmm
Just once in my life let me get what I want
Girl don't let me down;
Just once in my life let me hold onto
A good thing I've found, don't let me down. (fade)"""

A high AERIAL SHOT of the island features the Statue of Liberty
prominently in the foreground then TRAVELS ACROSS the harbor, OVER the
Battery and Lower Manhattan to Greenwich Village.
EXT. EAST 77TH STREET - DAY
A car is being hoisted up by a municipal tow truck while its owner is
having a terrible screaming arguement with a parking enforcement officer.
DANA BARRETT comes home pushing a baby buggy, struggling with two full
bags of groceries, and trying to dig her keys out of her purse. The
building superintendent FRANK, sees her struggling but pretends not to
notice.
DANA
(exasperated)
Frank, do you think you could give me a hand
with these bags?
FRANK
I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett. I'm a
building superintendent.
DANA
You're also a human being, Frank.
FRANK
(reluctantly going to help)
Okay, okay. It's not my job, but what the
hell. I'll do you a favor. He takes the
grocery bags from her.
DANA
(setting the wheel brakes on
the buggy)
Thank you, Frank. I'll get the hang of this
eventually.
She continues digging in her purse while Frank leans over the buggy and
makes funny faces at the baby, OSCAR, a very cute nine-month old boy.
FRANK
(to the baby)
Hiya, Oscar. What do you say, slugger?
FRANK
(to Dana)
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms.
Barrett.
DANA
(finding her keys)
Thank you, Frank. Oh, are you ever going to
fix the radiator in my bedroom? I asked you
last week.
FRANK
Didn't I do it?
BABY BUGGY
It starts to vibrate as if shaken by an unseen hand.
EXT. EAST 77TH STREET - BABY - DAY
He GURGLES with delight at the movement.
EXT. EAST 77TH STREET - DANA AND FRANK - DAY
Neither of them notice the movement of the carriage.
DANA
No, you didn't, Frank.
FRANK
Okay, that's no problem.
DANA
That's exactly what you said last week.
BUGGY WHEELS
The brakes unlock themselves.
DANA
She reaches for the handlebar of the buggy, but the buggy rolls forward
just out of her reach and stops. Surprised by the movement, she reaches
for the handlebar again, but this time the buggy rolls away even
further. Alarmed now, Dana hurries after it, but the buggy keeps
rolling down the street at ever increasing speed.
SIDEWALK
Dana chases the buggy down the street, shouting to passing pedestrians
for help, but every time someone reaches out to stop it, the buggy
swerves and continues unchecked.
INTERSECTION
Cars, trucks, and buses speed by in both directions as the buggy races
toward the corner.
DANA
She puts her head down and sprints after the buggy like an Olympian.
EXT. EAST 77TH STREET - INTERSECTION - DAY
A city bus is on a collision course with the speeding baby buggy.
BUGGY
It careens toward the corner.
EXT. EAST 77TH STREET - BABY - DAY
Its eyes are wide open with excitement.
EXT. EAST 77TH STREET - INTERSECTION - DAY
Bus and buggy are closing fast as the buggy bounces over the curb and
into the crosswalk.
BUS
The bus driver reacts in helpless horror as he sees the buggy enter the
intersection at high speed.
BUGGY
It comes to a dead stop right in the middle of the street. The bus
continues missing the buggy by inches.
INTERSECTION
Cars and trucks swerve and hit their brakes as Dana runs into the
intersection and snatches up the baby. She hugs it close, deeply
relieved, then looks at the buggy with the dawning awareness that the
supernatural has re-entered her life.
CUT TO:
EXT. UPPER WEST SIDE - NEW YORK CITY STREET - GHOSTBUSTERS LOGO - DAY
THEME MUSIC kicks in strongly as we see the familiar ""No Ghosts"" symbol
and PULL BACK to reveal that it's painted on the side of Ecto-1, the
Ghostbusters' emergency vehicle, which is speeding up Broadway on the
Upper West Side. RAY STANTZ is driving and WINSTON ZEDDEMORE is riding
shotgun.
EXT. WEST 77TH STREET - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)
The Ectomobile pulls up in front of a carefully-restored brownstone.
Stantz and Winston, wearing their official Ghostbuster uniforms, jump
out of the old ambulance, shoulder their proton packs and enter the
house.
INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
A WOMAN greets them and leads them through the expensively-furnished
house.
STANTZ
(all business)
How many of them are there, ma'am?
WOMAN
Fourteen. They're in the back. I hope you can
handle them. It's been like a nightmare.
WINSTON
How big are they?
She holds her hand out indicating about four feet.
WINSTON
(resolute)
We'll do our best, ma'am.
WOMAN
They're right out here.
She leads them to a set of French doors that open into another room.
Stantz and Winston pause to make final adjustments to their equipment.
STANTZ
Ready?
WINSTON
I'm ready.
STANTZ
Then let's do it.
He pushes through the French doors and they step into the room.
INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
They are immediately attacked by fourteen or fifteen screaming KIDS
between the ages of seven and ten.
KIDS
(disappointed)
Ghostbusters!! Boooo!!
Tables are set with party favors, ice cream and birthday cake and the
room is strewn with discarded toys and games. A couple of weary parents
sink onto lawn chairs as Stantz and Winston take over the party.
WINSTON
(trying his best)
How you doin', kids?
LITTLE BOY
(nasty)
I though we were having He-Man.
STANTZ
He-Man couldn't make it today. That's why
we're here.
BOY
My dad says you're full of crap.
STANTZ
(stopped cold)
Well, a lot of people have trouble believing
in the paranormal.
BOY
No, he just says you're full of crap and that's
why you went out of business.
He kicks Stantz in the leg. Stantz grabs him by the shirtfront.
STANTZ
(low and menacing)
I'm watching you.
(to Winston)
Song.
Winston switches on a tiny TAPE RECORDER which starts PLAYING the
Ghostbusters THEME SONG. Stantz and WInston start singing
STANTZ AND WINSTON
'There's something wrong in the neighborhood.
Who you gonna call?'
KIDS
(all together)
He-Man!!
CUT TO:
EXT. WEST 77TH STREET - DAY (LATER)
Stantz and Winston wearily load their equipment into the Ectomobile.
WINSTON
That's it, Ray. I've had it. No more parties.
I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged
nine-year-olds.
STANTZ
Come on, Winston. We can't quit now. The
holidays are coming up. It's our best season.
They get in the car
INT. ECTO-1 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
Stantz tries to start the car, but the engine won't turn over.
WINSTON
Give it up, Ray. You're living in the past.
Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore. In a year
these kids won't even remember who we are.
STANTZ
(tries to start the car again)
Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae. After all we
did for this city.
WINSTON
Yeah, what did we do, Ray? The last real job
we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow
man and blew the top three floors off an uptown
highrise.
STANTZ
Yeah, but what a ride. You can't make a
hamburger without chopping up a cow.
He turns the key again, the ENGING TURNS OVER, then starts GRINDING and
CLUNKING disastrously, chewing up vital parts and dropping twisted bits
of metal onto the pavement. Finally, with a BLAST of black sooty
exhaust from the tailpipe, Ecto-1 shudders and dies. Frustrated, Stantz
bangs his head lightly on the steering wheel
CUT TO:
INT. WKRR-TV STUDIO RECEPTION AREA - DAY (LATER)
A bank of monitors in the lobby show the program now running on WKRR,
Channel 10 in New York. We PUSH IN ON one of the monitors as a title
card and logo come up accompanied by some EERIE SYNTHESIZER MUSIC, and
we return to the show in progress: ""World of the Psychic with Dr. Peter
Venkman."" There is a video dissolve to a standard talk show set and
sitting there is our host PETER VENKMAN, the renowned and somewhat
infamous ex-Ghostbuster.
VENKMAN
He turns TO CAMERA and talks to his viewers in a suavely engaging tone,
understated and intimate.
VENKMAN
Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,'
I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest,
author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton
Anglund.
(to his guest)
Milt, your new book is called The End of the
World. Isn't that kind of like writing about
gum disease. Yes, it could happen, but do you
think anybody wants to read a book about it?
MILTON
Well, I think it's important for people to know
that the world is in danger.
VENKMAN
Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to
happen or do we have to buy the book?
MILTON
I predict that the world will end at the
stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
VENKMAN
This year? That's cutting it a little close,
isn't it? I mean, just from a sales point of
view, the book just came out, right? So you're
not even looking at the paperback release for
maybe a year. And it's going to be at least
another year after that if the thing has
movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential.
You would have been better off predicting 1992
or even '94 just to be safe.
MILTON
(irritated)
This is not just some money-making scheme! I
didn't just make up the date. I have a strong
psychic belief that the world will end on New
Year's Eve.
VENKMAN
(placating)
Well, for your sake, I hope you're right. But
I think my other guest may disagree with you.
Elaine, you had another date in mind?
The CAMERA REVEALS ELAINE, an attractive, aggressive New Jersey
housewife, sitting on the other side of Venkman.
ELAINE
According to my sources, the world will end
on February 14, in the year 2016.
VENKMAN
Valentine's Day. That's got to be a bummer.
Where did you get that date, Elaine?
ELAINE
I received this information from an alien. I
was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having
a drink in the bar when he approached me and
started talking. Then he must have used some
sort of ray or a mind control device because
he made me follow him to his room and that's
where he told me about the end of the world.
VENKMAN
Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
ELAINE
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made
up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn. I
can't be sure, Peter.
VENKMAN
(humoring her)
No, you can't, and I think that's the whole
problem with aliens; you just can't trust them.
You may get some nice ones occasionally like
Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to
be some kind of lizard. Anyway, we're just
about out of time.
(does his wrap-up right TO
the CAMERA)
Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless
pets.
(holds up a hairless cat)
Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...
(puts a finger to his temple
and sends out a though to his
viewers)
... Good night.
CUT TO:
INT. TV STUDIO - CORRIDOR - DAY (LATER)
Venkman comes out of the studio squabbling with his producer, NORMAN, a
well-meaning young incompetent.
VENKMAN
Where do you find these people? I thought
we were having the telekinetic guy who bends
the spoons?
NORMAN
A lot of the better psychics won't come on the
show. They think you're too skeptical.
VENKMAN
Skeptical! Norman, I'm a pushover. I think
professional wrestling is real.
There is a small commotion down the hall as two plainclothes cops come
out of the next studio followed by a group of mayoral assistants.
VENKMAN
(to Norman)
What's all this?
NORMAN
They just interviewed the mayor on 'Cityline.'
VENKMAN
The Mayor! He's a friend of mine.
Venkman starts down the hall as the MAYOR and his principal aide, JACK
HARDEMEYER, come walking out of the studio.
VENKMAN
(calling to the Mayor)
Lenny!
The Mayor sees Venkman, blanches and hurries off, pretending not to know
him.
VENKMAN
(starts to follow him)
Lenny! It's Pete Venkman!
The plainclothesmen cut Venkman off and Hardemeyer puts a heavy hand
against Venkman's chest.
HARDEMEYER
(snide)
Can I help you?
VENKMAN
(dangerous)
Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.
Hardemeyer smiles and drops his hand.
HARDEMEYER
I'm Jack Hardemeyer. I'm the mayor's assistant.
What can I do for you?
VENKMAN
I'm an old friend of the mayor's. I just
want to say hello to him.
HARDEMEYER
(scornful)
I know who you are, Doctor Venkman. Busting
any ghosts lately?
VENKMAN
No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor
about. We did a little job for the city a
while back and we ended up getting sued,
screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.
HARDEMEYER
(bristling)
Look, you stay away from the mayor. Next fall,
barring a disaster, he's going to be elected
governor of this state and the last thing we
need is for him to be associated with two-bit
frauds and publicity hounds like you and your
friends. You read me?
Hardemeyer walks off with the two cops.
VENKMAN
Okay, I get it. But I want you to tell Lenny
that, because of you, I'm not voting for him.
CUT TO:
EXT. MANHATTAN MUSEUM OF ART - DAY
The broad front steps of the museum are crowded with tourists and
visitors. Dana arrives carrying a portfolio and artist's tackle box and
enters the museum.
INT. MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (LATER)
We are FULL-FRAME ON a larger-than-life, full-figure portrait of VIGO
THE CARPATHIAN, a demented and sadistic 16th century despot with an
incredibly powerful evil presence. Then we PULL BACK to reveal the
studio, which is a large open space on the top floor of the museum, lit
by large skylights in the ceiling. Working on the Vigo painting is
JANOSZ POHA, a youngish art historian and painter, the head of the
department, quirky, intense and somewhat creepy. Janosz is staring
longingly across the room at Dana.
DANA
She is carefully cleaning a 19th Century landscape painting, still
preoccupied by the extraordinary near-accident with the buggy. Janosz
watches her for a moment, then comes up behind her and looks over her
shoulder.
JANOSZ
(with an East European accent)
Still working on the Turner?
Dana jumps, startled by the intrusion.
DANA
Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning,
Janosz.
JANOSZ
You know, you are really doing very good work
here. I think soon you may be ready to assist
me in some of the more important restorations.
DANA
Thank you, Janosz. I've learned a lot here,
but now that my baby's a little older, I was
hoping to rejoin the orchestra.
VIGO PAINTING
At the mention of Dana's baby, the figure of Vigo miraculously turns his
head and looks at Dana.
JANOSZ AND DANA
Neither of them notice the movement in the painting.
JANOSZ
(disappointed)
We'll be very sorry to lose you. Perhaps I
could take you to lunch today?
DANA
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today. I have
an appointment.
(looks at her watch)
In fact, I'd better go.
She starts gathering up her things.
JANOSZ
Every day I ask you, and every day you've got
something else to do. Do I have bad breath
or something?
DANA
(trying to brush him off)
I'm sorry. Perhaps some other time.
JANOSZ
Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that.
Janosz smiles at her as she exits, then goes back to his easel.
JANOSZ
(to himself)
I think she likes me.
He switches on an English language TAPE and starts practicing the
phrases as he resumes working.
CUT TO:
EXT. UNIVERSITY - DAY
Dana Barrett crosses the quad and enters a modern building. A sign
identifies it as ""The Institute for Advanced Theoretical Research.""
INT. UNIVERSITY - DAY (A LITTLE LATER)
Dana is explaining the buggy incident to EGON SPENGLER, the soberly
intellectual techno-wizard and former Ghostbuster, as he conducts an
experiment assisted by a research team of graduate students, all of whom
are Japanese, Chinese, or Korean. The device he is testing is a black
box about the size of a Sony Watchman with both digital and graphic
displays.
DANA
... and then the buggy just suddenly stopped
dead in the middle of the street
SPENGLER
Did anyone else see this happen?
DANA
Hundreds of people. Believe me, I didn't
imagine this.
SPENGLER
I'm not saying you did. In science we always
look for the simplest explanation.
An ASSISTANT interrupts.
ASSISTANT
We're ready, Dr. Spengler
SPENGLER
(to the Assistant)
We'll start with the negative calibration.
He picks up the device and prepares to test it.
DANA
(curious)
What are you working on, Egon?
SPENGLER
I'm trying to determine whether human
emotional states have a measurable effect on
the psychomagnetheric energy field. It's a
theory Ray and I were working on when we had
to dissolve Ghostbusters.
An assistant draws a curtain revealing a large picture window, actually
a two-way mirror, that looks into a small waiting room. Inside the
waiting room they can see but not hear a youngish couple having a heated
arguement.
SPENGLER
(to Dana)
They think they're here for marriage
counseling. We've kept them waiting for two
hours and we've been gradually increasing the
temperature in the room.
(checking a heat sensor)
It's up to 95 degrees at the moment. Now my
assistant is going to enter and ask them if
they'd mind waiting another half-hour.
As Spengler, Dana, and the research team watch, the assistant enters the
waiting room and tells the couple about the new delay. They explode
with anger both at him and each other while Spengler monitors them
through the glass. After recording his readings, he returns to his
Assistant.
SPENGLER
We'll do the happiness index next.
(to Dana)
I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if
it's all right with you.
DANA
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
SPENGLER
Oh no.
DANA
(affectedly casual)
Do you ever see him?
SPENGLER
Occasionally
DANA
How is he these days?
SPENGLER
Venkman? I think he was borderline for a
while there. Then he crossed the border.
DANA
Does he ever mention me?
SPENGLER
No. Not that I can recall.
They move to another two-way mirror through which they can see a lovely
little girl playing with a wonderful array of toys.
DANA
(slightly disappointed)
Well, we didn't part on very good terms and
we sort of lost track of each other when I
got married.
The Assistant interrupts again.
ASSISTANT
We're ready for the affection test.
SPENGLER
(to the assistant)
Good. Send in the puppy.
DANA
(continuing)
I thought of calling him after my marriage
ended, but --. Anyway, I appreciate you're
doing this, Egon
They watch as another assistant enters the playroom with an adorable
Cocker Spaniel puppy and gives it to the little girl. Spengler monitors
her as she jumps for joy and hugs the little dog.
DANA
(handing him a card)
This is my address and telephone number.
Will you call me?
SPENGLER
Certainly.
DANA
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of
this to Peter if you don't mind.
SPENGLER
I won't.
DANA
Thank you.
She shakes his hand and exits.
SPENGLER
(to his assistant)
Now let's see how she reacts when we take
away the puppy
CUT TO:
EXT. RAY'S OCCULT BOOK STORE - DAY (LATER)
It's a small basement shop located on a quaint commercial block in
Greenwich Village. The window is crowded with occult artifacts and old
books full of arcane metaphysical lore. The TELEPHONE RINGS.
STANTZ
(v.o., answering the phone)
Ray's Occult.
INT. RAY'S OCCULT BOOKS - CONTINUOUS
The shelves are jammed floor to ceiling with books on the paranormal.
Ray sits on a barstool behind the counter wearing an old cardigan
sweater over a T-shirt. He has on a pair of reading glasses and chews
on a battered, reeking pipe. As he talks on the phone he prepares a cup
of herb tea for Spengler who is thumbing through an arcane text.
STANTZ
(on the phone)
Yeah ... mmhmm ... What do you need? ... What
have I got? I've got alchemy, astrology,
apparitions, Bundu Magic Men, demon
intercession, U.F.O. abductions, psychic
surgery, stigmata, modern miracles, pixie
sightings, golden geese, geists, ghosts, I've
got it all -- what are you looking for? ...
Don't have any. Try the stockyards.
He hangs up.
SPENGLER
Who was that?
STANTZ
Some crank. Looking for goat hooves. Come
up with anything?
SPENGLER
(referring to the book)
This one's interesting. Berlin, 1939, a
flower cart took off by itself and rolled
approximately half a kilometer over level
ground. Three hundred eyewitnesses.
STANTZ
You might want to check those Duke University
mean averaging studies on controlled
psychokinesis.
SPENGLER
(going to the stacks)
Good idea.
The bones hanging over the door rattle as Venkman enters the shop.
VENKMAN
Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me. I'm
looking for an aerosol love potion I could
spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would
make her unconditionally submit to an unusual
personal request.
STANTZ
Oh, hiya, Pete.
VENKMAN
So, no goat hooves, huh?
STANTZ
(strung)
I knew that voice sounded familiar. What's
up? How's it going?
VENKMAN
Nowhere -- fast. Why don't you lock up and
buy me a sub?
STANTZ
(slightly evasive)
Uh, I can't. I'm kind of working on something.
Spengler steps out of the stacks.
VENKMAN
Egon!
SPENGLER
Hello, Venkman.
VENKMAN
How've you been? How's teaching? I bet
those science chicks really dig that big
cranium of yours, huh?
SPENGLER
I think they're more interested in my
epididymis.
VENKMAN
I don't even want to know where that is.
Venkman steps behind the counter and takes a beer from Ray's mini-fridge.
STANTZ
Oh, your book came in, Venkman. Magical
Paths to Fortune and Power.
He hands Venkman the book.
VENKMAN
Great.
(reading the contents)
So what are you guys working on?
STANTZ
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
VENKMAN
Who?
STANTZ
(at a loss)
Who? Just -- someone we know.
VENKMAN
Oh, Ray --
He grabs Stantz by both ears and pulls up.
VENKMAN
Who? Who? Who?
STANTZ
Aaah! Nobody! I can't tell you!
VENKMAN
Who, Ray?
STANTZ
(giving in)
Dana! Dana Barrett!
Venkman lets go of his ears and smiles. Spengler looks at Stantz and
shakes his head.
CUT TO:
INT. DANA'S APARTMENT - DAY (LATER)
The apartment is old and creatively furnished with a comfortable mix of
modern and traditional pieces. Maria, a young Hispanic woman who does
day care for Dana, is feeding the baby in the kitchen when the DOORBELL
RINGS.
CUT TO:
Dana enters from the bedroom and crosses to the front door. She opens
it and admits Ray and Egon.
DANA
(hugging Ray)
Hi, Ray. It's good to see you. Thanks for
coming.
STANTZ
No problem. Always glad to help -- and hug.
DANA
(to Spengler)
Hi, Egon.
She shakes his hand and is about to close the door when Venkman appears
in the doorway.
VENKMAN
Hi, Dana.
Dana is caught completely off guard by Venkman's surprise appearance.
VENKMAN
I knew you'd come crawling back to me.
She regards him coolly, as always amused and amazed at his
presumptuousness.
DANA
Hello, Peter.
VENKMAN
(to Dana)
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you
didn't call me first. I'm still into all
this stuff, you know. Haven't you ever seen
my show?
DANA
I have. That's why I didn't call you first.
VENKMAN
I can see that you're still very bitter about
us, but in the interest of science, I'm going
to give it my best shot. Let's go to work,
boys.
Stantz and Spengler begin a comprehensive parapsychological work-up on
the baby and the immediate physical environment.
VENKMAN AND DANA
Venkman starts nosing around the apartment. Dana follows him.
VENKMAN
So what happened to Mr. Right? I hear he
ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.
DANA
He didn't ""ditch"" me. We had some problems,
he got a good offer from an orchestra in
England and he took it.
VENKMAN
He ditched you. You should've married me,
you know.
DANA
You never asked me, and every time I brought
it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
VENKMAN
Men are very sensitive, you know. We need to
feel loved and desired, too.
DANA
Well, when you started introducing me as ""the
old ball and chain,"" that's when I left.
VENKMAN
I may have a few personal problems but one thing
I am is a total professional.
He leaves her and crosses to Spengler.
SPENGLER
He's taking a complete set of body and head measurements of the baby
with a tape measure and calipers.
VENKMAN
What are you going to do, Egon? Knit him a
snowsuit?
Spengler ignores the remark and hands Venkman a specimen jar.
SPENGLER
I'd like to have a stool specimen
VENKMAN
Yeah, you would. Is that for personal or
professional reasons?
VENKMAN
(picking up the baby)
Okay, kid. Up you go.
He starts clowning with the baby, holding him over his head and pressing
his nose into the baby's belly, pretending that the baby is attacking
him.
VENKMAN
Help! Please somebody help me! Get him off!
Quickly! He's gone completely berserk!
Dana is amused and somewhat disarmed by Venkman's rapport with the baby.
DANA
What do you think?
VENKMAN
There's no doubt about it. He's got his
father's looks. The kid is ugly -- extremely
ugly. And smelly.
(resumes playing with the baby)
You stink! It's just horrible. You are the
stinkiest baby I ever smelled.
(to Dana)
What's his name?
DANA
His name is Oscar.
VENKMAN
Oscar! You poor kid!
DANA
(losing patience)
Peter, this is serious. I need to know if you
think there's anything unusual about him.
VENKMAN
Unusual?
(holds up the baby and
scrutinizes him)
I don't know. I haven't had a lot of
experience with babies.
He looks at the baby, pulling his feet up, trying to get the sleeper
off.
DANA
(taking the specimen jar)
I'll do it.
VENKMAN
I'll supervise.
INT. DANA'S APARTMENT - NURSERY - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
Venkman enters and finds Stantz monitoring the room.
VENKMAN
(to Stantz)
Well, Holmes, what do you think?
STANTZ
It's an interesting one, Pete. If anything
was going on it's totally subdued now.
Spengler enters.
VENKMAN
(to Spengler)
What now, Brainiac?
SPENGLER
I think we should see if we can find
anything abnormal on the street.
VENKMAN
Finding something abnormal on the street
shouldn't be too hard.
CUT TO:
EXT. EAST 77TH STREET - DAY (LATER)
Dana walks down the street with Venkman, retracing the path of the
runaway buggy. Spengler and Stantz follow, monitoring PKE valences from
the pavement and the buildings.
VENKMAN
(to Dana, nostalgic)
Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't
it?
(pointing out familiar
neighborhood sights)
There's our old cash machine. And the dry
cleaners we used to go to. And the old
video store.
(he wipes away an imaginary
tear)
We really had some good times, didn't we?
DANA
We definitely had a moment or two.
Dana stops at the intersection and points to the middle of the street.
DANA
That's where the buggy stopped.
VENKMAN
Okay, let's take a look.
Venkman walks right out into the middle of the street, completely
oblivious to the CARS HONKING and whizzing past him and starts motioning
like a traffic cop, bringing traffic to a standstill. Then he signals
for Dana, Stantz and Spengler to join him in the middle of the street.
STANTZ
(reading the PKE meter)
Is this the spot?
DANA
A little to the left. Right there! That's
where it stopped.
Stantz reads the PKE meter.
STANTZ
Nothing. Not a trace.
SPENGLER
Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
VENKMAN
What's that?
STANTZ
Egon and I have been working on a gauge to
measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs -
giga electron volts.
SPENGLER
That's a thousand million electron volts.
VENKMAN
I knew that.
Spengler switches on the Giga-meter, the device he was testing in the
lab, and passes it over the spot on the street where the buggy stopped.
The indicator goes right into the red zone and the DEVICE starts CLICKING
WILDLY.
STANTZ
I think we hit the honeypot, boys. There's
something brewing under the street.
DANA
(worried, to Venkman)
Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic
problem or something that makes me vulnerable
to these supernatural things.
VENKMAN
You mean like the time you got possessed and
turned into a monster terror dog? No, not
a chance. Total coincidence.
(to Stantz and Spengler)
Am I right?
Stantz and Spengler look at him skeptically, not convinced by the
coincidence theory.
CUT TO:
INT. MANHATTAN MUSEUM OF ART - LATE AFTERNOON
The museum has just closed for the day and the last of the visitors and
employees are leaving.
INT. RESTORATION STUDIO - SAME TIME
Janosz is working late on the painting of Vigo.
VIGO PAINTING
Unnoticed by Janosz, the eyes of Vigo start to glow.
JANOSZ
He touches his brush to the canvas and a powerful current of red,
crackling energy surges through the brush and courses through his body,
driving him to his knees.
PAINTING
The figure of Vigo comes to life, turns toward Janosz and gestures
dramatically at him. Then he speaks to Janosz in a commanding voice.
VIGO
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the
sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
JANOSZ
(in agony)
Command me, lord.
VIGO
On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain,
I sat on a throne of blood. What was will
be, what is will be no more. Now is the
season of evil. Find me a child that I might
live again.
Bolts of red-hot energy shoot from the eyes of Vigo into Janosz's eyes.
He screams and falls to his knees.
CUT TO:
EXT. COFFEE SHOP - EAST 77TH STREET - NIGHT
Venkman and Stantz come out with small boxes containing coffee,
sandwiches and Danish and start walking up the street.
VENKMAN
I love this. We're onto something really
big. I can smell it, Ray. We're going to
make some headlines with this one.
STANTZ
Hey, hey, hey, stresshound! Are you nuts?
If anybody found out about this we'd be in
serious trouble. The judge couldn't have
been clearer - no ghostbusting.
VENKMAN
Relax. We're going to keep this whole thing
nice and quiet, low key, no profile.
EXT. EAST 77TH STREET - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
Spengler, wearing a hardhat, is JACKHAMMERING a hole in the middle of the
street. Safety cones and reflectors have been set up and a small area is
lit by strong work lights.
POLICE CAR
It turns onto East 77th Street, cruises slowly up to the makeshift
worksite and stops. The noise of the JACKHAMMER is so loud, Spengler
doesn't notice the police car and the two COPS inside looking at them.
Finally, he looks up, sees the police car and freezes.
FIRST COP
How ya doing?
SPENGLER
(reeking with guilt)
Fine! It's cutting fine now.
FIRST COP
(curious)
Why are you cutting?
SPENGLER
(looking for one of the
others)
Why are we cutting? Uh - boss!
Venkman and Stantz arrive just in time wearing Con Ed hardhats, doing a
good imitation of a Consolidated Edison repairman.
FIRST COP
What are you doing here?
VENKMAN
(belligerent)
What the hell's it look like we're doing?
We're bustin out asses over here cause
some douchebag downtown ain't got nothin'
better to do than make idiots like us work
late on a Friday night, right?
(looks to Spengler for
agreement)
SPENGLER
(with a ""right on"" fist)
Yo.
The cops seem satisfied by the explanation.
FIRST COP
Okay, boys, take it easy.
They drive off. Spengler breathes a great sigh of relief and starts
rubbing his sore shoulders.
SPENGLER
You were supposed to help me with this.
VENKMAN
You need the exercise.
Stantz resumes JACKHAMMERING, while Venkman and Spengler clear the
rubble from the hole. Suddenly he hits metal. They clear away
generations of paving material revealing an ornate iron manhole cover.
The manhole cover bears a strange logo and the letters NYPRR.
STANTZ
(examing it)
NYPRR. What the hell -- ? Help me lift
this.
They prey off the iron cover with crowbars, uncovering a very dark and
very deep abyss.
STANTZ
(shining a flashlight into
the hole)
Wow! It's an old airshaft. It just goes
forever.
Spengler leans in with the giga-meter which is reading even higher now.
SPENGLER
Very intense. We need a deeper reading.
Somebody has to go down there.
Venkman and Spengler both look at Ray.
STANTZ
Thanks, boys.
They snap Stantz into a harness and lower him into the hole on a strong
cable attached to a winch. Ray calls out orders to them as he descends
deeper and deeper.
STANTZ (O.S.)
(his voice echoing in the
airshaft)
Keep going -- more -- more --
INT. HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
Stantz rappels off the sides of the airshaft as he continues his descent
in total darkness.
STANTZ
(using a radio now)
Lower -- lower --
(to himself)
Gee, this really is deep.
Suddenly, his feet kick thin air as he gets to the bottom of the airshaft
and swings free in some kind of tunnel.
STANTZ
(shouts)
Hold it! Steady!
He pulls a powerful flashlight from his utility belt and shines it into
the tunnel below.
INT. VAN HORNE STATION - STANTZ'S POV - NIGHT
He is suspended near the top of a beautifully preserved chamber with
rounded, polished tile walls ardorned with intricate, colorfully enameled
Art Nouveau mosaics. A finely inlaid sign identifies it as VAN HORNE
STATION.
STANTZ
He pans the walls with his flashlight, admiring the excellent tilework,
and speaks quietly to Venkman and Spengler over his walkie-talkie.
STANTZ
(reverently)
This is it, boys, the end of the line. Van
Horne Station. The old New York Pneumatic.
It's still here.
EXT. EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
Venkman has no idea what he's talking about.
SPENGLER
(explaining)
The New York Pneumatic Railway. It was an
experimental subway system. Fan-forced
air-trains, built around 1870.
STANTZ
(over the walkie-talkie)
This is about as deep as you can go under
Manhattan without digging your own hole.
SPENGLER
(to Stantz)
What's the reading?
INT. VAN HORNE STATION - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
Stantz shines his flashlight on the meter and whistles at the extremely
high reading.
STANTZ
(on the radio)
Off the top of the scale. This place is
really hot. Lower me to the floor.
As Venkman and Spengler feed him some more cable, he pans his flashlight
down the wall of the station, """

STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""

Below him is a river of bubbling seething, glowing slime, a veritable,,,,,,,,""""""

As he stares into the foul effluent, we become aware of the strangely,,,,,,,,,""""""

STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He dangles from the end of the cable, holding his feet up as high as he,,,,,,,,,""""""
can. He unhooks a device from his utility belt and pulls the trigger on,,,,,,,,,,""""""
it, shooting out a long telescoping fishing-pole with a scoop on the end.,,,,,,,,,""""""
Reaching down, he scoops up a sample of the slime and starts retracting,,,,,,,,,""""""
the pole.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SLIME,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Suddenly, a grotesque arm with a long skeletal fingers reaches up out of,,,,,,,,,""""""
the slime and snatches at Stantz's dangling feet. He jerks his legs up,,,,,,,,,,""""""
as several more arms poke up out of the slime and reach for him.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(on the radio),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Haul me up, Venkman! Now!,,,,,,,,,""""""
EXT. EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Venkman and Spengler start hauling in the cable as a Con Ed Supervisor's,,,,,,,,,,""""""

burly SUPERVISOR gets out and crosses toward them, followed by the two,,,,,,,,,""""""

SUPERVISOR,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(no nonsense),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Okay, what's the story here?,,,,,,,,,""""""
Venkman and Spengler stop pulling up the cable and Venkman tries the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
belligerent worker ploy again, only this time he's wearing a Nynex,,,,,,,,,""""""
hardhat.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
What, I got time for this? We got three,,,,,,,,,""""""

Venkman pops Spengler on the head.,,,,,,,,,,""""""

STANTZ (O.S.),,,,,,,,,,""""""

One by one, all the streetlights go out; then the lights on all the,,,,,,,,,""""""

INT. DANA BARRETT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (SAME TIME),,,,,,,,,,""""""
She walks around in the dark lighting candles and placing them all over,,,,,,,,,,""""""
the living room. Then she finds a transistor radio and turns it on for,,,,,,,,,,""""""
information about the blackout. She listens to a special news report,,,,,,,,,,""""""
for a moment, then has a compelling impulse to go check on the baby.,,,,,,,,,""""""
She crosses to the nursery carrying a candle and quietly opens the door,,,,,,,,,,""""""
and looks in. Suddenly the DOORBELL RINGS, scaring her half to death.,,,,,,,,,""""""
Leaving the chain on the door, she opens it a crack and sees Janosz,,,,,,,,,""""""
standing in the hall, eerily lit by a red emergency spot at the end of,,,,,,,,,""""""
the hallway. He looks slightly dazed and even creepier.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(surprised),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Janosz?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANOSZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Hello, Dana. I happened to be in the,,,,,,,,,""""""

see if everything's all right with you --,,,,,,,,,,""""""
you know, with the blackout and everything?,,,,,,,,,""""""
Are you okay? Is the baby all right?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
His affected concern is chilling. She is frightened but conceals it,,,,,,,,,,""""""
from him.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(mechanically and cautiously),,,,,,,,,,""""""
We're fine, Janosz.,,,,,,,,,""""""
He tires to look around her into the apartment.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANOSZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Do you need anything? You want me to come,,,,,,,,,,""""""

DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
No, everything's fine. Honestly. Thanks,,,,,,,,,""""""

INT. COURTROOM - WITNESS STAND - NEXT DAY,,,,,,,,,,""""""
The JUDGE, a rather sour-looking jurist of the old school, calls the,,,,,,,,""""""
court to order.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JUDGE,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I want to make one thing very clear before,,,,,,,,,,""""""
we go any further. The law does not recognize,,,,,,,,,,""""""
the existence of ghosts, and I don't believe,,,,,,,,,""""""
in them either, so I don't want to hear a,,,,,,,,,""""""
lot of malarkey about goblins and spooks and,,,,,,,,,,""""""
demons. We're going to stick to the facts,,,,,,,,,,""""""
in this case and save the ghost stories for,,,,,,,,,,""""""
the kiddies. Understood?,,,,,,,,,,""""""

Stantz leans over and whispers to Spengler.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?,,,,,,,,,""""""
SPENGLER,,,,,,,,,,""""""
"His nickname is """"The Hammer.""""",,,,,,,,,,""""""
Stantz and Spengler are seated with their attorney LOUIS TULLY, lawyer,,,,,,,,,""""""
CPA and former demonic possession victim. Louis is desperately paging,,,,,,,,,,""""""
through a mountain of legal textbooks.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(nervous),,,,,,,,,,""""""
I think you're making a big mistake here,,,,,,,,,,""""""
fellas. I do mostly tax law and some probate,,,,,,,,,,""""""

That's all right. We got arrested at night.,,,,,,,,,,""""""

DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I wish I could stay. I feel personally,,,,,,,,,,""""""

VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
You are personally responsible. If I can,,,,,,,,,,""""""

Please don't say that. You won't go to prison.,,,,,,,,,,""""""

Do you know what this equipment is used for?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
CON ED,,,,,,,,,,""""""

I don't know. Catching ghosts, I guess.,,,,,,,,,""""""
PROSECUTOR,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(to the Judge),,,,,,,,,,""""""
May I remind the court that the defendants,,,,,,,,,,""""""
are under a judicial restraining order that,,,,,,,,,,""""""
specifically forbids them from performing,,,,,,,,,,""""""
services as paranormal investigators and,,,,,,,,,,""""""

Now, Mr. Fianella, can you identify the,,,,,,,,""""""

I been working underground for Con Ed for,,,,,,,,,,""""""
27 years and I never saw anything like that,,,,,,,,,,""""""

Venkman and Spengler look at Stantz.,,,,,,,,,,""""""

Hey, I didn't imagine it. There must have,,,,,,,,,""""""
been ten thousand gallons of it down there.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SPENGLER,,,,,,,,,,""""""
It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal,,,,,,,,,,""""""
source.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""

Should I say that?,,,,,,,,,,""""""

I doubt that they'd believe us.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Louis moans and goes back to his notes.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
WIPE TO:,,,,,,,,,,""""""

Venkman himself is on the stand and Louis is questioning him.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""

your old friend because she was scared and,,,,,,,,,,""""""
you didn't really mean to do anything bad,,,,,,,,,,""""""
and you really love the city and won't ever,,,,,,,,,,""""""
do anything like this again, right?,,,,,,,,,""""""
PROSECUTOR,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Objection, your Honor. He's leading the,,,,,,,,,""""""
witness.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JUDGE,,,,,,,,,,""""""
The witness is leading him. Sustained.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Okay, let me rephrase that question.,,,,,,,,,""""""
(to venkman),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Didn't you once coach a basketball team for,,,,,,,,,,""""""
underprivileged children?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Yes, I did. We were city champs.,,,,,,,,,""""""
PROSECUTOR,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Objection. Irrelevant and immaterial.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JUDGE,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Sustained. Mr. Tully, do you have anything,,,,,,,,,""""""
to ask this witness that may have some,,,,,,,,,,""""""
bearing on this case?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(to Venkman),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Do I?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
No, I think you've helped them enough already.,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(to the Judge),,,,,,,,,,""""""
No, I guess not.,,,,,,,,,""""""
(to the Prosecutor),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Your witness.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
The Prosecutor rises and approaches the witness stand with relish.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
PROSECUTOR,,,,,,,,,,""""""
So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court,,,,,,,,""""""
why it is you and your co-defendants took it,,,,,,,,,,""""""
upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
middle of the street.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many,,,,,,,,,,""""""
holes already we didn't think anyone would,,,,,,,,,,""""""
notice.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
The gallery laughs and the Judge gavels for order.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JUDGE,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in,,,,,,,,""""""
contempt.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets,,,,,,,,""""""
me up like that I can't resist.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
PROSECUTOR,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman. Why were,,,,,,,,,""""""
you digging the hole? And please remember,,,,,,,,,,""""""
that you're under oath.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I had my fingers crossed when they swore me,,,,,,,,,,""""""
in, but I'm going to tell you the truth.,,,,,,,,,""""""
There are things in this world that go way,,,,,,,,,,""""""
beyond human understanding, things that,,,,,,,,,""""""
can't be explained and that most people don't,,,,,,,,,,""""""
want to know about anyway. That's where we,,,,,,,,,,""""""
come in.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
PROSECUTOR,,,,,,,,,,""""""
So what are you saying? That the world of,,,,,,,,,,""""""
the supernatural is your special province?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens,,,,,,,,,""""""
and somebody has to deal with it.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
The spectators in the gallery cheer and the judge gavels for order.,,,,,,,,,,""""""

my clients frauds. Okay, the blackout was,,,,,,,,,""""""
a big problem for everybody. I was stuck in,,,,,,,,,,""""""
an elevator for about three hours and I had,,,,,,,,,,""""""
to go to the bathroom the whole time, but I,,,,,,,,,""""""
don't blame them because once I turned into,,,,,,,,,,""""""

He stares at Louis, astonished at his summation.,,,,,,,,,""""""
JUDGE,,,,,,,,,,""""""
That's it? That's all you have to say?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Did I forget something?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He searches through a disorderly pile of notes.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JUDGE,,,,,,,,,,""""""
That was unquestionably the worst,,,,,,,,,,""""""
presentation of a case I've ever heard in a,,,,,,,,,,""""""
court of law! I ought to cite you for,,,,,,,,,,""""""
contempt and have you disbarred. As for,,,,,,,,,,""""""
your clients, Peter Venkman, Raymond Stantz,,,,,,,,""""""
and Egon Spengler, on the charges of,,,,,,,,,""""""
conspiracy, fraud and the willful destruction,,,,,,,,,""""""
of public property, I find you guilty on all,,,,,,,,,""""""
counts. I order you to pay fines in the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
amount of $25,000 each and I sentence you to,,,,,,,,,""""""
eighteen months in the city correctional,,,,,,,,,,""""""
facility at Ryker's Island.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He sees the activity in the jar,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Uh-oh, she's twitchin'.,,,,,,,,,""""""
THE BENCH,,,,,,,,,,""""""
The Judge continues,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JUDGE,,,,,,,,,,""""""
And on a more personal note, let me go on,,,,,,,,,""""""
record as saying that there is no place in,,,,,,,,,,""""""
decent society for fakes, charlatans and,,,,,,,,,""""""
tricksters like you who prey on the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
gullibility of innocent people. You're,,,,,,,,,,""""""
beneath the contempt of this court. And,,,,,,,,,,""""""
believe me, if my hands were not tied by the,,,,,,,,,""""""
unalterable fetters of the law, a law which,,,,,,,,,""""""
has become in my view far too permissive and,,,,,,,,,,""""""
inadequate in it's standards of punishment,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I would invoke the tradition of our,,,,,,,,,,""""""
illustrious forebearers, reach back to a,,,,,,,,,""""""
sterner, purer justice and have you burned,,,,,,,,,""""""
at the stake!,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He hammers the bench with his gravel as the gallery erupts noisily. Then,,,,,,,,,,""""""
he feels a LOW RUMBLING TREMOR in the courtroom.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SPECIMEN JAR,,,,,,,,,,""""""
The slime starts to pulse and swell, pushing up the lid on the jar.,,,,,,,,,""""""
DEFENSE TABLE,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Stantz anticipates big trouble.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Under the table, boys!,,,,,,,,,""""""
The Ghostbusters duck under the defense table.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He stands up and looks around fearfully.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
INT. COURTROOM - GHOST BATTLE - DAY,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Everybody is silent now as the rumbling increases. All eyes turn to the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
exhibit table. Then suddenly all Hell breaks loose as TWO FULL-TORSO,,,,,,,,,,""""""
APPARITIONS explode out of the specimen jar.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JUDGE,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He looks up in terror at the two huge apparitions looming above him and,,,,,,,,,,""""""
recognizes them immediately.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JUDGE,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(in horror),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Oh, my God! The Scoleri Brothers!,,,,,,,,,""""""
SCOLERI BROTHERS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Big in life, even bigger in death, the ghostly Scoleri brothers seem ten,,,,,,,,""""""
feet tall. They are strapped into electric chairs and on their heads are,,,,,,,,,,""""""
metal electrocution caps with live, sparking electrical wires still,,,,,,,,,""""""
attached. Twenty-five hundred volts of electricity shoot through their,,,,,,,,,,""""""
bodies as they start to break free of the leather restraints, trying to,,,,,,,,,""""""
get at the Judge.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JUDGE,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Holding his gavel like a pitiful weapon, he crawls over to the defense,,,,,,,,,""""""
table where Venkman, Stantz and Spengler are now crouched, assessing the,,,,,,,,""""""
spectral intruders.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JUDGE,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(terrified),,,,,,,,,,""""""
You've got to do something!,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Who are they?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JUDGE,,,,,,,,,,""""""
They're the Scoleri Brothers. I tried them,,,,,,,,,,""""""
for murder. They were electrocuted up at,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Ossining in '48. Now they want to kill me.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Maybe they just want to appeal.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SCOLERI BROTHERS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
They break loose from the electric chairs, then turn toward the defense,,,,,,,,,""""""
table and BLAST it with HIGH-VOLTAGE FINGER-LIGHTNING.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
PROSECUTOR,,,,,,,,,,""""""
She sprints for the door, pursued by one of the Scoleri brothers.,,,,,,,,,""""""
GHOSTBUSTERS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
They jump to safety behind the rail of the jury box, pulling the Judge,,,,,,,,,""""""
with them.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
These boys aren't playing around.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JUDGE,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(desperately),,,,,,,,,,""""""
You've got to stop them. Please!,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(thinking like a lawyer),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Violating a judicial restraining order could,,,,,,,,,,""""""
expose my clients to serious criminal,,,,,,,,,,""""""
penalties. As their attorney I'd have to,,,,,,,,,,""""""
advise them against it.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SCOLERI BROTHERS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
They start punching through the jury box.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JUDGE,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He is just about hysterical with fear.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JUDGE,,,,,,,,,,""""""
All right! All right! I'm recinding the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
order. Case dismissed!!,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(he pounds his gavel on,,,,,,,,,,""""""
the floor),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Now do something!,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Let's go to work, boys.,,,,,,,,,""""""
With that, the Ghostbusters leap over the rail of the jury box and dash,,,,,,,,,""""""
across the courtroom to the exhibit table where their proton packs were,,,,,,,,,,""""""
being displayed as evidence. They strap them on hastily as the Brothers,,,,,,,,,,""""""
continue tearing up the seats looing for the Judge.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(slinging the pack onto,,,,,,,,,,""""""
his back),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(grabbing other gear),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Okay, let's heat 'em up!,,,,,,,,,""""""
They flip the power switches on their packs and draw their particle,,,,,,,,,,""""""
throwers.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
All right, throwers. Set for full neutronas,,,,,,,,,""""""
on stream.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
They switch on their throwers and turn to face the raging phantasms.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SCOLERI BROTHERS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
They are just about to wipe out the Judge when a loud shout distracts,,,,,,,,,,""""""
them.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Hey! Why don't you pick on someone your own,,,,,,,,,,""""""
size?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
The towering ghosts turn in a fury and raise their arms, ready to shoot,,,,,,,,,""""""
lightning at their new adversaries.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(to the others),,,,,,,,,,""""""
On my signal, boys. Open 'em up -- Now!,,,,,,,,,""""""
They all pull their triggers and the wands EXPLODE with incredible,,,,,,,,,,""""""
powerful STREAMS OF ENERGY, doing even more damage to the courtroom.,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Spengs, take the door. Ray, let's try and,,,,,,,,""""""
work them down and into the corner.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Working as a team, they gradually confine the Scoleri Brothers with the,,,,,,,,,""""""
streams, forcing them closer and closer to the traps Ray has set out on,,,,,,,,,""""""
the floor.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Watch it! I'm coming under you, Pete.,,,,,,,,,""""""
They circle around the two ghosts, prodding them with the streams while,,,,,,,,,""""""
ducking the lightning bolts shooting from their fingers. Finally, Ray,,,,,,,,,""""""
sees his chance and pops open the traps which emit inverted pyramids of,,,,,,,,,,""""""
light energy.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Steady -- watch your streams -- easy now --,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Venky, bring him left -- Spengy, pull him,,,,,,,,""""""
down -- trapping -- trapping -- now!,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He stomps on a control pedal and the Scoleri Brothers are drawn into the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
traps which snap shut.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
INT. COURTROOM - TRAPS - DAY,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LEDs on the outer casing start flashing, indicating the presence of a,,,,,,,,,""""""
ghost inside each trap.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""

Occupado.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
INT. COURTROOM - JUDGE - DAY (AFTER GHOST BATTLE),,,,,,,,,,""""""
He sticks his head up slowly from behind the debris of his bench and,,,,,,,,,,""""""
looks around in total amazement.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He crawls out from under a chair. Reporters and spectators get back on,,,,,,,,,,""""""
their feet and start buzzing about the incredible manifestation.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
PROSECUTOR,,,,,,,,,,""""""
She's lying on the floor, attended to by the Bailiff and the Court Clerk.,,,,,,,,,""""""
SPENGLER,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(to the Prosecutor),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Brilliant summation.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
GHOSTBUSTERS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
They break into big smiles as photographers start snapping pictures of,,,,,,,,,,""""""
them standing in the wrecked courtroom.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Case closed, boys. We're back in business.,,,,,,,,,""""""
The spectators cheer and applaud.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
CUT TO:,,,,,,,,,,""""""
EXT. FIREHOUSE - DAY,,,,,,,,,,""""""
The old, dilapidated Ghostbusters logo comes crashing to the ground,,,,,,,,,""""""
dropped by a pair of workmen on a ladder, and the new logo is hoisted,,,,,,,,,""""""
"into place over the main entrance. It's just like the original """"No",,,,,,,,,,""""""
"Ghosts"""" logo", but in the new one the ghost in the red circle is holding,,,,,,,,,""""""
up two fingers. Venkman enters the firehouse.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
INT. BEDROOM SET (TV COMMERCIAL - FULL SCREEN VIDEO) - NIGHT,,,,,,,,,,""""""
A man and his wife are lying in bed reading. The man is played by Louis,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Tully and JANINE MELNITZ, the Ghostbusters' once and future receptionist,,,,,,,,,""""""
is playing his wife. They are both terrible actors. Suddenly, a ghost,,,,,,,,,""""""
actually a very bad puppet on a wire, floats through the bedroom. Janine,,,,,,,,,""""""
sees it and screams.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
What is it, honey?,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANINE,,,,,,,,,,""""""
It's that darn ghost again! I don't know,,,,,,,,,,""""""
what to do anymore. He just won't leave us,,,,,,,,,,""""""
alone. I guess we'll just have to move.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Don't worry. We're not moving. He is.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He picks up the phone.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANINE,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Who are you going to call?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(with a wink),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Ghostbusters.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
As he starts to dial, the CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal the Ghostbusters,,,,,,,,,""""""
standing in the bedroom. Their acting isn't much better than Louis and,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Janine's.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
GHOSTBUSTERS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Stantz speaks directly TO the CAMERA.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""

That's right -- Ghostbusters. We're back,,,,,,,,,,""""""
and we're better than ever with twice the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
know-how and twice the particle-power to,,,,,,,,,,""""""
deal with all your supernatural elimination,,,,,,,,,,""""""
needs.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
During his speech, Winston can be seen in the b.g. pretending to trap the,,,,,,,,,""""""
fake ghost.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Careful, Winston. He's a mean one.,,,,,,,,,""""""
(TO CAMERA),,,,,,,,,,""""""
And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're,,,,,,,,,""""""
giving you twice the value with our special,,,,,,,,,,""""""
half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Hold on, Ray! Half-price! Have you gone,,,,,,,,,""""""
crazy?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I guess so, Pete, because that's not all.,,,,,,,,""""""
Tell them what else we've got, Egon.,,,,,,,,,""""""
Spengler actually mouths everyone else's dialogue along with them,,,,,,,,,,""""""
waiting for his cue.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SPENGLER,,,,,,,,,,""""""
You mean the Ghostbusters hot beverage,,,,,,,,,,""""""
thermal mugs and free balloons for the kids?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He holds up a mug and a limp, uninflated balloon.,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
You bet.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
As Stantz wraps it up, SUPERS APPEAR at the bottom of the SCREEN: FULLY,,,,,,,,,""""""
BONDED - FULLY LICENSED - SE HABLA ESPANOL.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""

So don't wait another minute. Make your,,,,,,,,,,""""""

INT. OFFICE AREA - LOUIS'S POV,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Slimer, a spud-like green ghost, is hovering over Louis's desk, scarfing,,,,,,,""""""
down Louis's bag lunch. Slimer looks up and sees Louis.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SLIMER AND LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
They both scream and run off in opposite directions.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SLIMER,,,,,,,,,,""""""

Runners of both sexes and all ages are huffing and puffing as they jog,,,,,,,,,,""""""
along the track that circles the reservoir. One of the runners looks,,,,,,,,,,""""""
behind him at the sound of APPROACHING FOOTFALLS and screams.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
GHOSTLY JOGGER,,,,,,,,,,""""""
A ghost jogger is loping along at a pretty fair pace. Other runners,,,,,,,,,,""""""
stumble and run screaming into the park as he passes them. Seemingly,,,,,,,,,,""""""
oblivious to the effect he's having, the ghost jogger puts two fingers to,,,,,,,,,""""""
his skeletal neck and checks his watch as if taking his pulse.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
EXT. CLEARING IN PARK - DAY (SAME TIME),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Venkman is sitting on a park bench near the jogging track reading the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
newspaper, eating a donut and drinking coffee from a Styrofoam cup.,,,,,,,,,""""""

He's sitting on a bench opposite Venkman's, casually watching the jogging,,,,,,,,,""""""
track.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
GHOST JOGGER,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He approaches the benches where the Ghostbusters are waiting. As the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
ghost jogger passes the benches, Stantz and Venkman simultaneously hit,,,,,,,,,""""""
concealed control buttons. A ghost trap buried in the track throws up a,,,,,,,,,,""""""
glowing inverted pyramid and catches the ghost jogger in mid-stride.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Stantz and Venkman close the trap and capture the ghost jogger.,,,,,,,,,,""""""

All the precious crystal is floating in the air, several feet above the,,,,,,,,,""""""
glass shelves and display tables. Stantz and Venkman are talking to the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
manager while Winston and Spengler set up an array of electronic devices,,,,,,,,,,""""""
positioned in each corner of the store.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
On a signal from Stantz, Spengler and Winston switch on the devices which,,,,,,,,,""""""
throw laser-type beams around the perimeter of the store. The manager,,,,,,,,,,""""""
watches in horror as all the GLASSWARE suddenly drops out of the air,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SMASHES through the GLASS SHELVES and SHATTERS on the display tables.,,,,,,,,,,""""""

DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
She stops, vaguely aware of the movement, and looks up curiously at the,,,,,,,,""""""
painting. As she starts to walk on, Vigo looks at her again, but Dana,,,,,,,,""""""
turns suddenly and catches the movement. Frightened now, she hastily,,,,,,,,,""""""
leaves the studio.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
INT. FIREHOUSE - DAY,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Louis is lurking behind a pillar, peeking out at the office area. We PAN,,,,,,,,,""""""
DOWN TO the floor and see a foot pedal, then PAN ALONG the cord TO a,,,,,,,,,""""""
ghost trap sitting on Louis's desk. Hanging from strings over the desk,,,,,,,,,,""""""
are several pieces of Kentucky fried chicken.,,,,,,,,,,""""""

Slimer partially emerges and furtively sniffs the air, then spots the,,,,,,,,,""""""
chicken bait. He licks his lips, materializes completely and flies to,,,,,,,,,""""""

Room 304 -- Restorations.,,,,,,,,,,""""""

Hey! Dr. Venkman -- 'World of the Psychic.',,,,,,,,,,""""""
I'm a big, big fan. That used to be one of,,,,,,,,,""""""
my two favorite shows.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(flattered),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Thanks. What's the other one?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SECURITY GUARD,,,,,,,,,,""""""
'Bass Masters.' It's a fishing show. Ever,,,,,,,,,,""""""

Yeah, really great. Take it easy.,,,,,,,,,""""""

Dana is working on a valuable Flemish still-life by Ver Meer. Janosz is,,,,,,,,,,""""""

Venkman enters and sneaks up behind Dana.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(looking at the Ver Meer),,,,,,,,,,""""""
So this is what you do, huh?,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(glad to see him),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Oh, hello, Peter.,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
You're really good, you know.,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I didn't paint it. I'm just cleaning it.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
It's an original Ver Meer. It's worth about,,,,,,,,,,""""""
ten million dollars.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VIGO,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He turns his head and watches Venkman and Dana.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Unaware that he's being watched, Venkman squints at the still life,,,,,,,,,""""""
holding up his thumb like he's seen artists do.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
You know you can go to Art World and get,,,,,,,,,,""""""
these huge sofa-size paintings for about,,,,,,,,,,""""""
forty-five bucks.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He starts looking around at the other artwork in the studio.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk,,,,,,,,,,""""""
about art.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell,,,,,,,,,""""""
you that I haven't forgotten your problem,,,,,,,,,,""""""
and that we're still on the case.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
They are interrupted by the sudden appearance of Janosz.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANOSZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(smiling at Venkman),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to,,,,,,,,,""""""
your friend?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Oh, I'm sorry. This is Peter Venkman.,,,,,,,,,""""""
Peter, Janosz Poha.,,,,,,,,,""""""
Venkman warily shakes his hand, trying to size him up.,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANOSZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(avoiding his gaze),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Pleasure to meet you. I've seen you on,,,,,,,,,,""""""
television.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
How are you?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(looking over at the Vigo,,,,,,,,,,""""""
painting),,,,,,,,,,""""""
What's that you're working on, Johnny?,,,,,,,,,""""""
Janosz winces at the nickname but lets it go. Venkman and Dana cross to,,,,,,,,,,""""""
the Vigo painting. Janosz steps protectively in front of it.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANOSZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
It's a painting I'm restoring for the new,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Byzantine exhibition. It's a self-portrait,,,,,,,,,,""""""
of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian. He ruled,,,,,,,,,""""""
most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Century.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(staring at the painting),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Too bad for the Moldavians.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANOSZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(defensive),,,,,,,,,,""""""
He was a very powerful magician. A genius,,,,,,,,,,""""""
in many ways and quite a skilled painter.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I hate this painting. I've felt very,,,,,,,,,,""""""
uncomfortable since they brought it up from,,,,,,,,,,""""""
storage.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want,,,,,,,,,""""""
to hang in the rec room. You know what it,,,,,,,,,,""""""
needs?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(picking up a brush),,,,,,,,,,""""""
A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Venkman reaches toward the painting, but Janosz grabs his hand.,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANOSZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(with forced good will),,,,,,,,,,""""""
We don't go around altering valuable,,,,,,,,,,""""""
paintings, Dr. Venkman.,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Well, I'd make an exception in this case if,,,,,,,,,""""""
I were you.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Dana looks disapprovingly at Venkman.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(to Janosz),,,,,,,,,,""""""
I'll let you get back to it. Nice meeting,,,,,,,,,,""""""
you.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANOSZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
My pleasure.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Venkman and Dana cross back to her workspace.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(confidentially),,,,,,,,,,""""""
I may be wrong, but I think you've got a,,,,,,,,,""""""
little crush on this guy.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Good-bye, Peter.,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(dragging his feet),,,,,,,,,,""""""
I'd like to stay, but I really don't have,,,,,,,,,""""""
time to hang around here. I'll call you.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(calls out to Janosz),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Later, Johnny!,,,,,,,,,""""""
He exits.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VIGO,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Vigo turns his head and follows Dana as she returns to her workbench.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
She stops, vaguely aware of the movement, and looks up curiously at the,,,,,,,,""""""

It's not that thing you do with your,,,,,,,,,,""""""

Stantz goes to the refrigerator, opens the freezer, rummages around among,,,,,,,,""""""
the TV dinners and frozen pizza and pulls out a slime specimen in a,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Tupperware container.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(to Venkman),,,,,,,,,,""""""
We've been studying the stuff that we took,,,,,,,,,,""""""

He pops the specimen jar in the microwave and lets it thaw for a minute.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
And now you're going to eat it?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.,,,,,,,,,""""""
He takes the specimen out of the microwave and pours some of it into a,,,,,,,,,,""""""

STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Now watch this.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He leans over the specimen and starts shouting at it.,,,,,,,,,,""""""

(as the slime starts to,,,,,,,,,,""""""
twitch and glow),,,,,,,,,,""""""
You ignorant disgusting blob!!,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SPECIMEN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
It bubbles and swells, changing color with each insult.,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
You foul, obnoxious muck!!,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He continues venting his rage on the slime.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I've seen some real crud in my time, but,,,,,,,,,""""""
you're a chemical disgrace!!,,,,,,,,,,""""""
The specimen doubles its size and starts spilling over the rim of the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Petri dish.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ AND SPENGLER,,,,,,,,,,""""""
They turn to Venkman for his reaction. He's dumbfounded.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
This is what you do with your spare time?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(very excited),,,,,,,,,,""""""
This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman.,,,,,,,,,""""""
A psychoreactive substance! Whatever this,,,,,,,,,,""""""
is, it clearly responds to human emotional,,,,,,,,,""""""
states.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
'Mood slime.' We ought to bottle this stuff,,,,,,,,,,""""""
and sell it.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SPENGLER,,,,,,,,,,""""""
We've found it at every event site we've,,,,,,,,,,""""""
been to lately.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
WINSTON,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(poking at the slime),,,,,,,,,,""""""
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad,,,,,,,,,,""""""
vibes'?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Like a goat on garbage.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
We're running tests to see if we can get an,,,,,,,,,,""""""
equally strong positive reaction.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
What kind of tests?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(a little embarrassed),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say,,,,,,,""""""
supportive, nurturing things --,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
You're not sleeping with this stuff, are you?,,,,,,,,,""""""
Spengler reacts as if he might be.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
It really responds to music.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(to Spengler),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Let's calm it down.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
"Spengler picks up a guitar and he and Stantz start singing """"Cumbaya"""" to",,,,,,,,,,""""""
the slime specimen.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SPECIMEN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
It stops bubbling and starts to shrink.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
WINSTON,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Does it have any favorites?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,',,,,,,,,,""""""
'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small,,,,,,,,,""""""
World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Venkman and Winston watch intently as Spengler spoons some of the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
psych-reactive slime onto an old toaster.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Watch this.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
"Stantz turns on a CASSETTE PLAYER and Jackie Wilson's """"HIGHER AND HIGHER""""",,,,,,,,,,""""""
BLASTS from the speakers.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
TOASTER,,,,,,,,,,""""""
It shakes, spins and actually starts moving in time with the MUSIC.,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He stares in disbelief at the dancing toaster as it shoots two pieces of,,,,,,,,,,""""""
toast into the air and catches them without missing a beat.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I don't care what you say. This could be a,,,,,,,,,,""""""
major Christmas gift item.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
WINSTON,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Right, and the first time someone gets mad,,,,,,,,,""""""
their toaster will eat their hand.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
So we'll put a warning on the label.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Stantz turns OFF the MUSIC and the toaster stops moving. Venkman looks,,,,,,,,,,""""""
at the toaster and sticks his fingers in the slot.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(to the toaster),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Go ahead. I dare you.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Suddenly, he yelps as if the toaster has actually bitten into his hand,,,,,,,,,""""""
and won't let go. The others jump in to help him, but Venkman laughs and,,,,,,,,,""""""
easily withdraws his hand.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Just kidding.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
CUT TO:,,,,,,,,,,""""""
INT. DANA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Dana brings Oscar into the bathroom and lays him on the bassinet. She's,,,,,,,,,,""""""
wearing a robe over her nightgown, preparing to bathe the baby. She,,,,,,,,,""""""
turns the taps on the old claw-footed bathtub, checks the water,,,,,,,,,""""""
temperature, then turns away and starts to undress the baby.,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(talking sweetly to the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
baby),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Look at you. I think we got more food on,,,,,,,,,,""""""
your shirt than we got in your mouth.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
BATHTUB,,,,,,,,,,""""""
The water pouring from the faucet changes to slime and settles at the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
bottom of the tub. Dana reaches over and turns off the water without,,,,,,,,,,""""""
looking into the tub. When she turns away, both taps start to spin by,,,,,,,,,""""""
themselves and the tub flexes and bulges.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Still unaware, she routinely reaches over and squirts some bubble bath,,,,,,,,,""""""
into the tub.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
BATHTUB,,,,,,,,,,""""""
The rim of the tub puckers up and the sides convulse as if swallowing the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
bubble bath.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
She picks the baby up off the bassinet and turns to place him in the tub.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
She is just about to lower him into the water when the tub starts to,,,,,,,,,,""""""
close up around the baby like a hugh mouth. Dana screams, snatches the,,,,,,,,,""""""
baby away and runs from the room clutching Oscar to her bosom as the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
bathtub convulses and vomits up buckets of slime.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
CUT TO:,,,,,,,,,,""""""
INT. VENKMAN'S LOFT - SAME NIGHT (LATER),,,,,,,,,,""""""
The big open loft space is a chaotic clutter of mismatched furniture, old,,,,,,,,,""""""
magazines, books, tapes, and sports equipment. Venkman is asleep on the,,,,,,,""""""
floor, still wearing his coat, scarf, hat and gloves, having collapsed,,,,,,""""""
just short of the bedroom. The DOORBELL RINGS, he wakes up, lumbers to,,,,,,,,""""""
his feet and answers it. He opens the door and sees Dana standing there.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
She is wearing only a nightgown under her coat and Oscar is naked,,,,,,,,,,""""""
wrapped in a baby blanket.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(somewhat embarrassed to,,,,,,,,,,""""""
be there),,,,,,,,,,""""""
I'm sorry. Were you on your way out?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(surprised to see her),,,,,,,,,,""""""
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago.,,,,,,,,,""""""
Come on in.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(noting her apparel),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Are we having a pajama party?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(upset),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.,,,,,,,,,""""""
Venkman looks at her for a long moment.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd,,,,,,,,""""""
have serious doubts. But coming from you,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I can't honestly say I'm surprised.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I must be losing my mind. At the museum,,,,,,,,,,""""""
today I could have sworn that terrible,,,,,,,,,,""""""
painting of Vigo looked right at me.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Who could blame him? Were you wearing this,,,,,,,,,,""""""
nightgown?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(distraught),,,,,,,,,,""""""
I don't know what to do anymore.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
bathtub. You better stay here.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He exits to the bathroom. She looks around the loft, amazed at the,,,,,,,,,""""""
disorder. Venkman comes back immediately with an old sweatshirt and,,,,,,,,,,""""""
takes Oscar from her.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Now this kid has a serious nudity problem.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He spreads the sweatshirt out on the sofa, lays the baby on it and starts,,,,,,,,,""""""
tying it around him like a diaper.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(to the baby),,,,,,,,,,""""""
This is Joe Namath's old number, you know.,,,,,,,,,""""""
You could get a lot of chicks with this.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Just don't pee in it.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Peter, what about the bathtub?,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(grabs the phone and dials),,,,,,,,,,""""""
We'll take care of that.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(on the phone),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Ray, Pete. Listen, get over to Dana's right,,,,,,,,""""""
away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one --,,,,,,,,,,""""""
tried to eat the kid.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
It was full of this awful pink ooze.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(to Ray),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Sounds like another slime job ... No,,,,,,,,,,""""""
they're all right. They're here now ...,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Right ... Let me know.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He hangs up.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
They're going over there right now. You,,,,,,,,,,""""""
might as well make yourself at home. Let,,,,,,,,,,""""""
me show you around.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(he crosses to the kitchen area),,,,,,,,,,""""""
This is the cuisine de maison --,,,,,,,,,,""""""
It's an incredible mess. The sink is piled high with dirty dishes and the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
counters are littered with all sorts of food trash. He grabs a big open,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Hefty bag on the floor and starts throwing garbage into it.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(looking at the sink),,,,,,,,,,""""""
We may have to wash some of these if you get,,,,,,,,,,""""""
hungry --,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(he looks in the fridge),,,,,,,,,,""""""
-- but there's no food anyway so forget,,,,,,,,,,""""""
about it. I have all kinds of carry-out,,,,,,,,,,""""""
menus if you feel like ordering.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He opens a drawer full of pizza, barbecue and Chinese food menus, then,,,,,,,,""""""
crosses to the bathroom.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy,,,,,,,,,,""""""
up a few things.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have,,,,,,,,""""""
to do any of this, you know.,,,,,,,,,""""""
He goes into the bathroom and we hear WATER RUNNING, the TOILET FLUSHING,,,,,,,,,""""""
and more items going into the Hefty bag.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN (O.S.),,,,,,,,,,""""""
The shower works but it's a little tricky.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
"They're both marked """"Hot."""" It takes a little",,,,,,,,,,""""""
practice, but at least this one won't try,,,,,,,,,""""""
and eat you.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He comes out of the bathroom with the now-loaded Hefty bag over his,,,,,,,,,,""""""
shoulder.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
But the bed's good and I just changed the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
sheets so if you get tired, feel free. In,,,,,,,,,""""""
fact, I think you should definitely plan on,,,,,,,,,""""""
spending the night here.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Really? And how would we handle the sleeping,,,,,,,,,,""""""
arrangements?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
For me it's best if I sleep on my side and,,,,,,,,,,""""""
you spoon up right behind me with your arms,,,,,,,,,,""""""
around me. If we go the other way I'm,,,,,,,,,,""""""
afraid your hair will be getting in my face,,,,,,,,,,""""""
all night.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
How about you on the sofa and me in bed with,,,,,,,,,,""""""
the baby.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Or we could do that.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Thank you.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(she picks up Oscar),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Poor baby. I think I should put him down,,,,,,,,,,""""""
now.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I'll put him down for you.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(taking the baby),,,,,,,,,,""""""
You are way too short! And your belly-button,,,,,,,,,,""""""
sticks out! You're nothing but a burden to,,,,,,,,,,""""""
your poor mother!,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Venkman carries the baby into the bedroom leaving Dana in the living,,,,,,,,,,""""""
room, feeling more relaxed and a lot safer.,,,,,,,,,""""""
CUT TO:,,,,,,,,,,""""""
EXT. MUSEUM - DAY (NEXT MORNING),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Venkman is waiting in front of the building as ECTO-2 pulls up and,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Stantz, Spengler and Winston get out and report on Dana's apartment.,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Did you find anything at Dana's?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Nothing. Just some mood-slime residue in,,,,,,,,,,""""""
and around the bathtub. But we did turn up,,,,,,,,,,""""""
some interesting stuff on this Vigo character,,,,,,,,,,""""""
you mentioned. I found the name Vigo the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Martyrs and Madmen. Listen to this:,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SPENGLER,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(reads from xerox of entry),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505," died 1610 --""""",,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
A hundred and five years? He really hung,,,,,,,,,,""""""
on, didn't he.,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
And he didn't die of old age either. He was,,,,,,,,,,""""""
poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched,,,,,,""""""
disemboweled, drawn and quartered.,,,,,,,,,""""""
WINSTON,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I guess he wasn't too popular at the end,,,,,,,,,,""""""
there.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SPENGLER,,,,,,,,,,""""""
No, not exactly a man of the people.,,,,,,,,,""""""
(reads),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the,,,,,,,,,""""""
Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the,,,,,,,,""""""
"Unholy.""""",,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
This guy was a bad monkey. He dabbled in,,,,,,,,,,""""""
all the Black Arts, and listen to this,,,,,,,,,""""""
prophecy. Just before his head died, his,,,,,,,,,""""""
last words were," """"Death is but a door", time,,,,,,,,""""""
"is but a window. I'll be back.""""",,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
"That's it? """"I'll be back?""""",,,,,,,,,,""""""
SPENGLER,,,,,,,,,,""""""
It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
They enter the museum carrying their monitoring equipment.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
INT. MUSEUM - SECURITY DESK - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Rudy the guard looks up in surprise as the Ghostbusters enter.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
RUDY,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Hey, Dr. Venkman. What's going on?,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
We're just going up to Restorations for a,,,,,,,,,,""""""
minute.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
RUDY,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Oh, I can't let you do that. Mr. Poha told,,,,,,,,,""""""
me not to let you up there anymore.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(with mock seriousness),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Okay, we were trying to keep this quiet but,,,,,,,,,""""""
I think you can be trusted. Tell him, Ray.,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(very official),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Mister, you have an Ecto-paritic,,,,,,,,,""""""
subfusionary flux in this building.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
RUDY,,,,,,,,,,""""""
We got a flux?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
WINSTON,,,,,,,,,,""""""
You got a flux and a half.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Now if you don't want to be the --,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(he counts),,,,,,,,,,""""""
#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
from a planar rift, I suggest you get down,,,,,,,,,""""""
behind that desk and don't move until we,,,,,,,,,,""""""
"give you the signal """"Stabilize -- All Clear.""""",,,,,,,,,,""""""
Rudy gulps and starts to hunker down behind the desk as the Ghostbusters,,,,,,,,,,""""""
head upstairs.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
INT. MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (MOMENTS LATER),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Janosz is working on the Vigo painting when the Ghostbusters enter. He,,,,,,,,,,""""""
rushes over and stops them at the door.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANOSZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Dr. Venkman? Dana is not here.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I know.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANOSZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Then why have you come?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
We got a major creep alert and we're just,,,,,,,,,,""""""
going down the list. Your name was first.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(to Spengler and Winston),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Let's sweep it, boys.,,,,,,,,,""""""
They deploy and start scanning the studio with their monitoring devices.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(to Janosz),,,,,,,,,,""""""
You know, I never got to ask you. Where you,,,,,,,,,""""""
from, Johnny?,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANOSZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(nervous),,,,,,,,,,""""""
The Upper West Side.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SPENGLER,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(consulting his PKE meter),,,,,,,,,,""""""
This entire room is extremely hot, Peter.,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANOSZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
What exactly are you looking for, Dr. Venkman?,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
We'll know when we find it. You just sit,,,,,,,,,,""""""
tight. This won't take long.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Using the Giga-meter, he traces a strong psychomagnetheric reading to,,,,,,,,,""""""
the painting of Vigo in the alcove at the end of the studio. Venkman,,,,,,,,,,""""""
comes up behind him with Janosz right on his heels.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
This is the one that looked at Dana.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANOSZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
It must be the chemical fumes in the studio.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
People start imagining things --,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(interrupts),,,,,,,,,,""""""
I'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing,,,,,,,,,,""""""
theory. If she says it looked at her, it,,,,,,,,,""""""
looked at her.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(to Vigo),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Hey, you! Vigie! Look at me. I'm talking,,,,,,,,,""""""
to you. Hey! Look at me when I'm talking,,,,,,,,,,""""""
to you.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
They watch the painting for any sign of movement.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VIGO,,,,,,,,,,""""""
His eyes stare lifelessly into the distance.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ AND VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Venkman starts shooting Polaroids of Vigo.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(to Vigo),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Beautiful, beautiful. Work with me, baby.,,,,,,,,""""""
Just have fun with it.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(to Stantz),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Okay, he's playing it cool. Let's finish,,,,,,,,,""""""
up and get out of here.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I'll get one more reading.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Venkman walks off leaving Stantz alone with the painting. Stantz scans,,,,,,,,,,""""""
the painting with the Giga-meter until his eyes meet Vigo's.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VIGO,,,,,,,,,,""""""
His eyes seems to burn right through to the depths of Stantz's soul.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He stands there transfixed, unable to look away, as a strange and subtle,,,,,,,,""""""
transformation occurs within him. Winston comes up behind him and breaks,,,,,,,,,,""""""
the spell.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
WINSTON,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(looking at the painting),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Now that's one ugly dude.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(coming back to his senses),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Huh? What?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
WINSTON,,,,,,,,,,""""""
You finished here?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(distracted),,,,,,,,,,""""""
What? Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
WINSTON,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Are you all right? You coming down with,,,,,,,,,,""""""
something?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
No, I'm fine. I just got light-headed for,,,,,,,,,""""""
a second there. Let's go.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
They head for the door.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANOSZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He escorts the Ghostbusters to the door.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANOSZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
So you see, everything is in order, is it,,,,,,,,""""""
not?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Not. Don't leave town and report any change,,,,,,,,,,""""""
in your address to the proper authorities.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
We'll be back.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
They exit.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
CUT TO:,,,,,,,,,,""""""
EXT. MUSEUM - DAY (LATER),,,,,,,,,,""""""
The Ghostbusters cross to ECTO-2.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SPENGLER,,,,,,,,,,""""""
There's definitely something going on in,,,,,,,,,,""""""
that studio. The PKE levels were max-plus,,,,,,,,,,""""""
and the Giga-meter was showing all red.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
WINSTON,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I'd put my money on that Vigo character.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Yeah, that's a safe bet.,,,,,,,,,""""""
(to Stantz),,,,,,,,,,""""""
You and Spengman see what else you can dig,,,,,,,,,,""""""
up on Vigo and this little weasel Poha.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Those two were made for each other.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
INT. ECTO-2 - DAY (LATER),,,,,,,,,,""""""
The Ghostbusters are driving back to the firehouse. Stantz is at the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
wheel. His eyes are vacant, he seems distracted and very tense. Stantz,,,,,,,,,""""""
swerves suddenly and HONKS the horn angrily.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(to another driver),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Idiot!,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(honking),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Move it, you jerk!,,,,,,,,,""""""
Venkman and Winston exchange surprised looks.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
EXT. STREET - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Stantz drives extremely fast, HONKING vindictively, weaving dangerously,,,,,,,,""""""
through traffic.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
INT. ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Winston looks at Ray, concerned.,,,,,,,,,""""""
WINSTON,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Going a little fast, aren't we, Ray?,,,,,,,,""""""
Stantz turns on him.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(viciously),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Are you telling me how to drive?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
WINSTON,,,,,,,,,,""""""
No, I just thought --,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Well don't think!,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He HONKS again and tromps hard on the accelerator.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
EXT. STREET - DAY (CONTINUOUS),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Ecto-2 is now barreling down the avenue. Pedestrians leap to safety as,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Stantz runs a red light.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
INT. ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION),,,,,,,,,,""""""
They hang on to the safety straps as Stantz continues his maniacal ride.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
WINSTON,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(to Stantz, really worried,,,,,,,,,""""""
now),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Are you crazy, man? You're going to kill,,,,,,,,,""""""
somebody!,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Stantz looks at him and smile demonically.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
No, I'm going to kill everybody!,,,,,,,,,""""""
He swerves off the road.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
EXT. ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION),,,,,,,,,,""""""
The car heads right for a big tree.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
INT. ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION),,,,,,,,,,""""""
At the last possible moment, Winston cold-cocks Stantz, grabs the wheel,,,,,,,,""""""
and steps across to stomp on the brakes.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
EXT. ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION),,,,,,,,,,""""""
The car skids into the tree and stops. The Ghostbusters stumble out,,,,,,,,,,""""""
dazed and shaken, but unhurt. Stantz rubs his eyes and looks at the,,,,,,,,,""""""
others, completely at a loss.,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(himself again),,,,,,,,,,""""""
What happened?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
You just picked up three penalty points on,,,,,,,,,,""""""
your driver's license.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
WINSTON,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Are you all right?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Yeah, I guess so. It was the strangest,,,,,,,,,""""""
thing. I knew what I was doing but I,,,,,,,,,,""""""
couldn't stop. This really terrible feeling,,,,,,,,,,""""""
came over me and -- I don't know -- I just,,,,,,,,,,""""""
felt like driving into that tree and ending,,,,,,,,,,""""""
it all. Whew! Sorry, boys.,,,,,,,,,""""""
They inspect the damage to the car.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(confidentially, to,,,,,,,,,""""""
Spengler),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Watch him, Egon. Don't even let him shave.,,,,,,,,,""""""
CUT TO:,,,,,,,,,,""""""
INT. VENKMAN'S LOFT - DAY (LATER),,,,,,,,,,""""""
There's a KNOCK at the front door, a key turns in the lock, and Venkman,,,,,,,,""""""
enters somewhat tentatively holding a bouquet of flowers and a small,,,,,,,,,,""""""
suitcase of Dana's.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(calls out),,,,,,,,,,""""""
I'm home!,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He looks around the large open loft.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(to himself),,,,,,,,,,""""""
I knew it. She cleaned.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He hears the SHOWER RUNNING and crosses to the bathroom. The door is,,,,,,,,,,""""""
half-open and he can see Dana in the shower (tastefully blurred) through,,,,,,,,,,""""""
the transparent vinyl curtain. He closes the bathroom door and looks at,,,,,,,,,,""""""
the baby asleep on the bed, surrounded by pillows to prevent him rolling,,,,,,,,,""""""
off. Then he turns and bumps into Dana who's just coming out of the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
bathroom wrapped in a towel. She jumps back into the bathroom.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
She comes out again, this time wearing a robe.,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Are you all squeaky clean now?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(humoring him),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Yes, I'm very clean. Did they find anything,,,,,,,,,""""""
at my apartment?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
She squeezes past him into the bedroom and closes the door.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(through the door),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Nothing. They stayed there all night, went,,,,,,,,,""""""
through your personal stuff, made a bunch of,,,,,,,,,""""""
long-distance phone calls and cleaned out,,,,,,,,,,""""""
your refrigerator. And didn't find anything.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Dana opens the bedroom door.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
They didn't find anything? In the bathtub,,,,,,,,,,""""""
... the pink ooze ... nothing? So, what do,,,,,,,,,""""""
I do now?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Now you get dressed and we go out. I got a,,,,,,,,,,""""""
babysitter and everything. Trust me, you,,,,,,,,,""""""
need it.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I'm not here to date. I can't leave Oscar,,,,,,,,,,""""""
in a strange place with someone I don't know.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff. She's,,,,,,,,,""""""
one of my most valuable employees.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Does she know anything about babies?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?,,,,,,,,,""""""
(handing her the flowers),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Do I have a vase? I brought some of your,,,,,,,,,,""""""
clothes. Wear something intriguing. I,,,,,,,,,,""""""
brought along some interesting possibilities.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Okay, but it's not a date. It's a dinner.,,,,,,,,,""""""
She smiles and closes the door again. He opens the closet and starts,,,,,,,,,,""""""
looking for his good suit.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Did you happen to see some shirts on the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
floor in here?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA (O.S.),,,,,,,,,,""""""
I put them in your hamper. I thought they,,,,,,,,,,""""""
were dirty.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(shaking his head),,,,,,,,,,""""""
I have a hamper? Next time ask me first,,,,,,,,,,""""""
okay. I have more than two grades of,,,,,,,,,,""""""
laundry. There're lots of subtle levels,,,,,,,,,,""""""
between clean and dirty.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He pulls some clothes out of the hamper and inspects them.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
These aren't so bad yet. You just hang them,,,,,,,,,,""""""
up for a while and they're fine.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
CUT TO:,,,,,,,,,,""""""
INT. FIREHOUSE - RECEPTION AREA - EARLY EVENING,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Janine covers her computer terminal and starts turning out the lights.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Then she notices that the lights are still on upstairs. She starts,,,,,,,,,,""""""
primping and freshening up her makeup.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
INT. FIREHOUSE - LAB AREA - SAME TIME,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Louis is strapping on a proton pack, preparing to deal with Slimer once,,,,,,,,,""""""
and for all. He's wearing a bicyclist's rearview mirror on a headband.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(to himself),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Okay, Stinky, this is it. Showdown time.,,,,,,,,""""""
You and me, pal. You think you're smarter,,,,,,,,,""""""
than I am? We'll see about that.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(loud),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Oh, hello, Pizza Man! Oh, two larges! I,,,,,,,""""""
only ordered one. Oh, pepperoni and,,,,,,,,,""""""
pineapple. My absolute favorite. I guess,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I'll have to eat these both by myself.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
THE CEILING,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Slimer pokes his head through the ceiling and scans the room hanging,,,,,,,,,,""""""
upside down.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He spots Slimer through the rearview mirror.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(quietly),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Okay, let's boogie!,,,,,,,,,""""""
He whirls around and fires a proton stream at Slimer, slicing a burning a,,,,,,,,,""""""
gash across the ceiling.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
THE STAIRS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Janine comes up and ducks as a bolt of energy streaks across the room and,,,,,,,,,,""""""
strikes the wall behind her. Slimer disappears.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(embarrassed and apologetic),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Oh migod! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do,,,,,,,,,,""""""
that. It was an accident.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANINE,,,,,,,,,,""""""
What are you doing up here?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I was trying to get that smelly green thing.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
The guys asked me to help out. I'm like the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
fifth Ghostbuster.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANINE,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if,,,,,,,,,,""""""
you're already an accountant?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls,,,,,,,,""""""
in sick or gets hurt.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Louis quickly slips off the proton pack and sets it down.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANINE,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Have you made any plans yet? You know,,,,,,,,,,""""""
tomorrow is New Year's Eve.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
No, I celebrate at the beginning of my,,,,,,,,,""""""
corporate tax year which is March first.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
That way I beat the crowds.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANINE,,,,,,,,,,""""""
That's very practical. I hate going out on,,,,,,,,,,""""""
New Year's Eve, too.,,,,,,,,,""""""
There is an awkward silence between them and Janine starts to leave.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANINE,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Well, good night, Louis.,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(on an impulse),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting,,,,,,,,,""""""
something to eat on the way home?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANINE,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd,,,,,,,,,""""""
babysit.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(seductively),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Do you want to babysit with me?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Oh, sure, that sounds great.,,,,,,,,""""""
They exit.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
CUT TO:,,,,,,,,,,""""""
INT. VENKMAN'S LOFT - NIGHT (LATER),,,,,,,,,,""""""
There is a KNOCK at the door and Venkman goes to answer it. He's dressed,,,,,,,,,,""""""
for the evening and looking very dapper.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
INT. VENKMAN'S LOFT - ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS ACTION,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Venkman opens the door and finds Stantz, Spengler and Winston standing,,,,,,,,,""""""
there wearing over-the-hip rubberized waders, firemen's slickers, and,,,,,,,,""""""
miners' helmets, carrying tons of sensing devices, meters, collection,,,,,,,""""""
jars and photographic equipment. They look like they're rigged out for a,,,,,,,,,,""""""
major spelunking expedition.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(ushering them in),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Don't tell me, let me guess. All-you-can-eat,,,,,,,,,""""""
barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
We're going down into the sewer system to,,,,,,,,,,""""""
see if we can trace the source of the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
psycho-reactive slime flow. We thought you,,,,,,,,,,""""""
might want to come along.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Darn it! I wish I'd known you were going.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SPENGLER,,,,,,,,,,""""""
You know, animals and lower life forms often,,,,,,,,,""""""
anticipate major disasters. Given the new,,,,,,,,,,""""""
magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous,,,,,,,,,,""""""
breeding surge in the cockroach population.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Roach breeding? Sounds better and better.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(calls out),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Dana? The boys are going down under the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
sewers tonight to look for slime. Egon,,,,,,,,,,""""""
thinks there might even be some kind of big,,,,,,,,,,""""""
roach-breeding surge. Should we forget about,,,,,,,,,,""""""
dinner and go with them instead?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Dana steps into the living room looking very beautiful.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Wow.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Dana looks curiously at their outfits.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Hi.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
They nod and wave back.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(to Ray and Egon),,,,,,,,,,""""""
I think we're going to have to pass on the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
sewer trip, boys. Let me know what you find,,,,,,,,,""""""
out.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(on his exit),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Okay, but you're missing all the fun.,,,,,,,,,""""""
INT. VAN HORNE STATION - NIGHT (LATER),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Stantz, Spengler and Winston come down the stairs into the station,,,,,,,,,""""""
guided by a very old map of the underground city.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
This is it. Van Horne Station. Right where,,,,,,,,,,""""""
the old transit map said it would be.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
They cross to the edge of the platform and look into the river of slime.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Let's get a sounding on the depth of that,,,,,,,,,,""""""
flow.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Stantz has a long, coiled, graduated cord with a plumb bob on the end of,,,,,,,,""""""
it attached to his utility belt.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Stand back.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He takes the cord in his hand, swings the plumb bob over his head and,,,,,,,,,""""""
casts it out into the middle of the flow. The plumb bob sinks and,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Spengler reads the depth.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SPENGLER,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Six feet -- seven -- eight --,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
That's it. It's on the bottom.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SPENGLER,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Nine feet -- ten --,,,,,,,,,,""""""
WINSTON,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Is the line sinking?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SPENGLER,,,,,,,,,,""""""
No, the slime is rising.,,,,,,,,,""""""
Stantz looks down and notices the slime rising over the edge of the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
platform and around his boots.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(alarmed),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Let's get out of here, boys.,,,,,,,,,""""""
He starts to pull out the plumb line but it seems to be stuck.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Spengler tries to help, but whatever is pulling on the cord is stronger,,,,,,,,,""""""
than all three of them. As their unseen adversary pulls them closer and,,,,,,,,,,""""""
closer to the edge, Stantz works desperately to unhook the cord from his,,,,,,,,,""""""
belt but finally just unhooks the whole belt. Spengler lets go in time,,,,,,,,,,""""""
but Winston doesn't. He is jerked off his feet and into the slime flow.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Stantz and Spengler look at each other, summon their courage and jump in,,,,,,,,,""""""
after him.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
CUT TO:,,,,,,,,,,""""""
INT. ARMAND RESTAURANT - NIGHT (LATER),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Dana and Venkman are sitting at a table in an elegant restaurant nibbling,,,,,,,,,,""""""
caviar and toasting with very expensive champagne.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(very intimate),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Here's to -- us.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
She sighs and drinks.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
So -- are you making any New Year's,,,,,,,,,,""""""
resolutions?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I want to stop getting involved with men who,,,,,,,,,,""""""
aren't good for me.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow,,,,,,,,,,""""""
or could you hold off for a few days maybe?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
For one night in your life, do you think,,,,,,,,,""""""
it's possible for us to be completely real?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
All right, you want to be real? So tell me,,,,,,,,,""""""
why did you dump me?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you. I just had,,,,,,,,""""""
to protect myself. You really weren't very,,,,,,,,,,""""""
good for me, you know.,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I'm not even good for me.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Why do you say things like that? You're so,,,,,,,,,,""""""
much better than you know.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Thank you. If I had that kind of support,,,,,,,,,,""""""
on a daily basis, I could definitely shape,,,,,,,,,""""""
up by the turn of the century.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(already feeling the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
effects of the champagne),,,,,,,,,,""""""
So why don't you give me a jingle in the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
year 2000?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Let me jingle you right now.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He leans over to kiss her.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Maybe I should call Janine.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Don't worry. Janine has a very special way,,,,,,,,,,""""""
with children.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
They kiss.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
CUT TO:,,,,,,,,,,""""""
INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT (SAME TIME),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Janine is on the sofa doing her nails while Louis paces with the baby.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANINE,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(looking around),,,,,,,,,,""""""
I can't believe a person could actually live,,,,,,,,,,""""""
like this.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(to the baby),,,,,,,,,,""""""
So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in,,,,,,,,,,""""""
a small mining operation and then one day a,,,,,,,,,,""""""
beautiful princess came to live with them.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANINE,,,,,,,,,,""""""
It's really not a bad place. It just needs,,,,,,,,,,""""""
a woman's touch.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(continuing),,,,,,,,,,""""""
So they bartered room and board in exchange,,,,,,,,,,""""""
for housekeeping services, which was a good,,,,,,,,,""""""
deal for all of them because then they didn't,,,,,,,,,,""""""
have to withhold tax and social security,,,,,,,,,,""""""
which I'm not saying is right but it's just,,,,,,,,,,""""""
a story, so I guess it's all right. I can,,,,,,,,,""""""
finish this later if you're tired.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Louis goes into the bedroom and puts the baby down.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANINE,,,,,,,,,,""""""
You're really good with children, Louis. I,,,,,,,,,""""""
can tell.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(as he returns),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Why don't you come here and sit with me?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Okay.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He sits stiffly beside her on the sofa.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANINE,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(getting close),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Motherhood is a very natural instinct for,,,,,,,,,,""""""
me. I'd like to have a baby myself.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Wouldn't you?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(gulps),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Tonight?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
EXT. STREET - MANHOLE COVER - NIGHT (SAME TIME),,,,,,,,,,""""""
A manhole cover is dislodged and pushed up from below. It slides away,,,,,,,,,,""""""
and Winston crawls out of the manhole followed by Stantz and Spengler.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
They are exhausted and covered with slime.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
WINSTON,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(uncharacteristically,,,,,,,,,,""""""
angry),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Nice going, Ray! What were you trying to,,,,,,,,,""""""
do -- drown me?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(unusually mean),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were,,,,,,,,""""""
too stupid to drop that line.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
WINSTON,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(shoves him),,,,,,,,,,""""""
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll,,,,,,,,""""""
punch your lights out.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Oh yeah? Anytime, anytime. Just go ahead,,,,,,,,,""""""
and try it.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Spengler steps between them with unprecedented aggression.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SPENGLER,,,,,,,,,,""""""
If you two are looking for a fight, you got,,,,,,,,,""""""
one.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(putting up his fists),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Who wants it first? Come on, Ray. Try me,,,,,,,,,""""""
sucker.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(squaring off),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Butt out, you pencil-necked geek. I've had,,,,,,,,,""""""
it with you.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
They grab each other and start to tussle. Suddenly Spengler comes to his,,,,,,,,,,""""""
senses and pulls them apart.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SPENGLER,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(forcefully),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Strip! Right now! Get out of those clothes!,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He starts yanking off his slicker and waders. Bewildered, Stantz and,,,,,,,,,""""""
Winston start doing the same. Spengler helps pull off their clothes and,,,,,,,,,,""""""
throws them into the open manhole. Now wearing only long underwear, they,,,,,,,,,""""""
seem to return to normal.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
WINSTON,,,,,,,,,,""""""
What are we doing? Ray, I was ready to kill,,,,,,,,,""""""
you.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Don't you see? It's the slime. That stuff,,,,,,,,,,""""""
is like pure, concentrated evil.,,,,,,,,,""""""
Stantz looks around and sees that they are standing right in front of the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
museum.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SPENGLER,,,,,,,,,,""""""
And it's all flowing right to this spot.,,,,,,,,,,""""""

MAITRE D',,,,,,,,,,""""""
(intercepting them),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Can I help you?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Stantz looks around and spots Venkman.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
That's all right, I see him.,,,,,,,,,""""""
They blow right by the Maitre d' who jumps back in horror as they pass.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He's just about to pour more champagne when he sees Ray, Egon and Winston,,,,,,,,,""""""
coming toward him through the restaurant.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(very excited),,,,,,,,,,""""""
You should've been there, Venkman.,,,,,,,,,""""""
Absolutely incredible!,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Yeah, sorry I missed it.,,,,,,,,,""""""
(noting their attire),,,,,,,,,,""""""
I guess you guys didn't know about the dress,,,,,,,,,,""""""
code here. It's really kind of a coat and,,,,,,,,,,""""""
tie place.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
It's all over the city, Pete -- well, under,,,,,,,,""""""
it actually.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
WINSTON,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Rivers of the stuff!,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SPENGLER,,,,,,,,,,""""""
And it's all flowing toward the museum.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He gestures excitedly and a big gob of slime flies across the room and,,,,,,,,,,""""""
lands on a well-dressed diner.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(calls out),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Sorry!,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Venkman notes the look of alarm on Dana's face and pulls his colleagues,,,,,,,,,,""""""
aside.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(confidentially),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Boys, listen. You're scaring the straights.,,,,,,,,,""""""
Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?,,,,,,,,,""""""

This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman.,,,,,,,,,""""""
It's hot and it's ready to pop.,,,,,,,,,,""""""

makes straight for Venkman's table.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
MAITRE D',,,,,,,,,,""""""
Arrest these men.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
COP,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(recognizing them),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Hey! It's the Ghostbusters. You're out of,,,,,,,,,,""""""
uniform, gentlemen,,,,,,,,,""""""
Stantz suddenly realizes how ridiculous they look.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(self-conscious),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Uh -- well -- we had a little accident, but,,,,,,,,,""""""
forget that. We have to see the mayor as,,,,,,,,,,""""""
soon as possible.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
COP,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Look, Doc, why don't you just go home.,,,,,,,,""""""
You'll get a good night's sleep and then you,,,,,,,,,,""""""
can give the mayor a call in the morning.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Come on.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He takes Stantz by the arm but Stantz resists.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
We're not going anywhere with you. I told,,,,,,,,,,""""""
you we have to see the mayor now.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
COP,,,,,,,,,,""""""

I'm warning you. You can come along,,,,,,,,,,""""""

Hey, don't be an idiot. This is serious.,,,,,,,,,""""""

Oh, yeah?,,,,,,,,,""""""
COP,,,,,,,,,,""""""

This is a matter of vital importance.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Venkman steps in and looks at the policemen's nametags.,,,,,,,,,,""""""

VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I just want to get your names right for when,,,,,,,,,,""""""

Oh, he's fine. He's such a good baby. He,,,,,,,,,""""""

HARDEMEYER,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(smirking),,,,,,,,,,""""""
That's quite a story.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Yeah, I think the Times might be interested,,,,,,,,,""""""
don't you? The Post might have a lot of fun,,,,,,,,,,""""""
with it, too.,,,,,,,,,""""""
Hardemeyer's eyes go cold and calculating.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
HARDEMEYER,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Before you go running to the newspapers with,,,,,,,,,,""""""
this, would you consider telling this slime,,,,,,,,,""""""
thing to some people downtown?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Now you're talking.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
CUT TO:,,,,,,,,,,""""""
INT. PARKVIEW HOSPITAL - PSYCHIATRIC WARD - NIGHT (LATER),,,,,,,,,,""""""
An attendant opens a locked door with a wire mesh window and the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Ghostbusters, in straitjackets, are led into the psych ward as Hardemeyer,,,,,,,,""""""
confers with the chief PSYCHIATRIST.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
WINSTON,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(protesting),,,,,,,,,,""""""
I'm telling you, we're not crazy. He is!,,,,,,,,,""""""
HARDEMEYER,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He laughs off the remark.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
HARDEMEYER,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(to the Psychiatrist),,,,,,,,,,""""""
The mayor wants them kept under strict,,,,,,,,,,""""""
observation for a few days. We think,,,,,,,,,,""""""
they're seriously disturbed and potentially,,,,,,,,,,""""""
dangerous.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
PSYCHIATRIST,,,,,,,,,,""""""
We'll do whatever's necessary.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Hardemeyer shakes his hand and exits as the door slams shut on the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Ghostbusters.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
INT. VENKMAN'S LOFT - NIGHT (SAME TIME),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Louis and Janine are watching an old rerun on TV, eating popcorn, while,,,,,,,,""""""
Dana is stretched out on the other sofa.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(wishing they'd leave),,,,,,,,,,""""""
You know you really don't have to stay.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Peter should be back soon.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Oh no, we don't mind.,,,,,,,,,""""""
She hears a little CRY from the nursery and sits up.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Excuse me. I think Oscar is up.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
She crosses to the bedroom.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
INT. VENKMAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Dana enters and immediately notices that the crib is empty and the window,,,,,,,,,,""""""
is open.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""

Louis!,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Frantic now, Dana rushes to the window and looks out, as Louis and Janine,,,,,,,,""""""
come running in.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
EXT. WINDOW LEDGE - DANA'S POV - NIGHT (ECLIPSE),,,,,,,,,,""""""
The baby is standing out on the ledge at the corner of the building,,,,,,,,,,""""""
fifty feet above the street, staring off into the distance as if he's,,,,,,,,,""""""
waiting for something.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
EXT. WINDOW LEDGE - NIGHT (ECLIPSE) (CONTINUOUS ACTION),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Dana climbs out onto the ledge and starts inching slowly toward the baby.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Then she stops as a miraculous apparition materializes.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS AND JANINE,,,,,,,,,,""""""
They lean out the window, gaping at the apparition.,,,,,,,,,""""""
EXT. VENKMAN'S LEDGE - APPARITION,,,,,,,,,,""""""
A sweet, kindly-looking English nanny appears, pushing a pram, strolling,,,,,,,""""""
on thin air parallel to the ledge high above the ground. Her face looks,,,,,,,,,,""""""
remarkably like Janosz Poha's. The nanny extends her hand to the BABY,,,,,,,,,,""""""
who GURGLES sweetly as he reaches out to take it.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
She watches in helpless horror.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(screams),,,,,,,,,,""""""
No!!,,,,,,,,,,""""""
GHOST NANNY,,,,,,,,,,""""""
She picks up the baby and lays it gently in the pram, then turns and,,,,,,,,,""""""
smiles at Dana. The smile turns to a hideous grin, then the nanny,,,,,,,,,""""""
shrieks at Dana and takes off like a shot with the baby.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
She watches the creature fly off with Oscar, then climbs back through,,,,,,,,,""""""
the window assisted by Louis and Janine.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(resolutely),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Louis, you have to find Peter and tell him,,,,,,,,,""""""
what happened.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(confused and worried),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Where're you going?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
To get my baby back.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
CUT TO:,,,,,,,,,,""""""
EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT (A LITTLE LATER),,,,,,,,,,""""""
A taxi pulls up, Dana jumps out and rushes into the museum. The moment,,,,,,,,,""""""
the door closes behind her, there is a loud THUNDERCLAP, the ground,,,,,,,,""""""
trembles and a massive amount of slime erupts from around the base of,,,,,,,,,,""""""
the museum and starts covering the walls, sealing her inside the,,,,,,,,,""""""
building.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
CUT TO:,,,,,,,,,,""""""
INT. PARKVIEW PSYCHIATRIC - PADDED ROOM - NIGHT (SAME TIME),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Venkman, Stantz, Spengler and Winston are in a padded cell. They are,,,,,,,,""""""
handcuffed and the cuffs are chained to thick leather belts around their,,,,,,,,,,""""""
waists. Venkman stands there banging his head into the padded wall,,,,,,,,,,""""""
while the others try to explain the situation to a skeptical,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Psychiatrist.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
We think the spirit of Vigo the Carpathian,,,,,,,,,,""""""
is alive in a painting at the Manhattan,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Museum.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
PSYCHIATRIST,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I see. And are there any other paintings in,,,,,,,,,,""""""
the museum with bad spirits in them?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SPENGLER,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(impatient),,,,,,,,,,""""""
You're wasting valuable time! We have reason,,,,,,,,,,""""""
to believe that Vigo is drawing strength from,,,,,,,,,,""""""
a psychomagnetheric slime flow that's been,,,,,,,,,,""""""
collecting under the city.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
PSYCHIATRIST,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Yes, tell me about the slime.,,,,,,,,,""""""
WINSTON,,,,,,,,,,""""""
It's potent stuff. We made a toaster dance,,,,,,,,,,""""""
with it, then a bathtub tried to eat his,,,,,,,,,""""""
friend's baby.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
The psychiatrist looks at Venkman.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Don't look at me. I think they're nuts.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
CUT TO:,,,,,,,,,,""""""
INT. MUSEUM RESTORATION STUDIO - NIGHT (SAME TIME),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Moonlight streams through the skylight above, bathing the studio in,,,,,,,,,""""""
eerie white light. Oscar is lying safely on a table in front of the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
painting of Vigo. Dana enters cautiously and sees the baby. Seeing no,,,,,,,,,,""""""
one else about, she quickly sneaks down to the table and picks up the,,,,,,,,,""""""
baby, hugging hin tight, greatly relieved to find him unharmed and,,,,,,,,""""""
intact.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANOSZ (O.S.),,,,,,,,,,""""""
I knew you would come.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Startled, Dana turns at the sound of his voice as Janosz steps out from,,,,,,,,,""""""
behind the Vigo painting.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(defiantly),,,,,,,,,,""""""
What do you want with my baby?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANOSZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
No harm will come to the child. You might,,,,,,,,,,""""""
even say it's a privilege. He will be the,,,,,,,,,,""""""
vessel for the spirit of Vigo. And you --,,,,,,,,,,""""""
well, you will be the mother of the ruler,,,,,,,,,""""""
of the world. Doesn't that sound nice?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
If this is what the world will be like, I,,,,,,,,,""""""
don't want to live in it.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANOSZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(confidentially, indicating,,,,,,,,,""""""
Vigo),,,,,,,,,,""""""
I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Everybody has a choice.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANOSZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Not in this case, my dear. Take a look.,,,,,,,,,""""""
That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He's Vigo!,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I don't care who he is. He's not taking my,,,,,,,,,,""""""
baby.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Dana walks quickly to the door but suddenly Oscar flies out of her arms,,,,,,,,,,""""""
floats across the room and lands lightly back in the cradle.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
She turns and looks at Vigo, for the first time feeling his power.,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANOSZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
You will see. It's all for the best.,,,,,,,,,,""""""

This is it. boys. It's starting. Shit-storm,,,,,,,,,,""""""

Venkman is doing occupational therapy, weaving on a little hand-loom.,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
It better not start yet. I'm trying to,,,,,,,,,,""""""

You think all those predictions about the,,,,,,,,,,""""""

LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Come on, Sherm. You're my cousin. Do this,,,,,,,,,""""""
for me. I'm begging you.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SHERMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I can't do it, Louis. It isn't ethical. I,,,,,,,,,""""""
could lose my license.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Why can't you just have them released?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
You're a doctor.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SHERMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I'm a dermatologist. I can't write orders,,,,,,,,,,""""""

LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.,,,,,,,,,""""""
SHERMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Like what?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SHERMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
You were the one who got me in.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she,,,,,,,,,,""""""
put out, didn't she?,,,,,,,,,""""""
SHERMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion,,,,,,,,,""""""
for a year. Forget it, Louis. I could get,,,,,,,,,""""""
in a lot of trouble.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I'm telling you, we're all going to be in,,,,,,,,,""""""
big trouble if we don't do something fast.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
That ghost guy came and took my friend's,,,,,,,,,,""""""
baby and we got to get it back. It's just,,,,,,,,,,""""""
a scared little baby, Sherm.,,,,,,,,,""""""

comes alive. MINK HEADS pop out of the thick fur, SNARLING, BARKING and,,,,,,,,""""""
YAPPING, their sharp, little teeth biting the air. Reacting quickly, the,,,,,,,""""""
doorman yanks the coat off the woman's back, throws it to the ground and,,,,,,,,,""""""

Venkman looks up at the Statue of Liberty looming above them.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?,,,,,,,,,""""""
WINSTON,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Wonder what?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
If she's naked under that toga. She's,,,,,,,,,,""""""
French, you know.,,,,,,,,,""""""
SPENGLER,,,,,,,,,,""""""
There's nothing under that toga but 300 tons,,,,,,,,,,""""""

Stantz is looking worried.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.,,,,,,,,,,""""""

various relays on the interior surface of the statue. Venkman and Stantz,,,,,,,,,,""""""
are mounting large auditorium loudspeakers near the top of the staircase.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
They finish the installation, then Stantz dons one of the new backpacks,,,,,,,,,""""""

I'm not sure this is such a good idea? Do,,,,,,,,,,""""""
they know you're doing this?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Oh, yeah, sure -- no. But there's really,,,,,,,,""""""
not much to do here and they might need,,,,,,,,,,""""""
some back-up at the museum.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANINE,,,,,,,,,,""""""
You're very brave, Louis. Good luck.,,,,,,,,,""""""
She kisses Louis and he gets extremely self-conscious.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
LOUIS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Uh -- oh -- well, I better hurry.,,,,,,,,,""""""
He rushes out.,,,,,,,,,,""""""

I've lived in New York all my life and I,,,,,,,,,,""""""

VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
It's okay. I have my Senior Lifesaving card.,,,,,,,,,,""""""

With a water temperature of forty degrees,,,,,,,,,,""""""
we'd survive approximately fifteen minutes.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Stantz studies a maritime navigational chart.,,,,,,,,,,""""""

I'll keep to the middle of the channel.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go,,,,,,,,,""""""
ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Are you kidding? We'll hit all that bridge,,,,,,,,,,""""""

DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
We don't have a relationship.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANOSZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I know. Marry me, Dana, and together we,,,,,,,,""""""
will raise Vigo as our son. There are many,,,,,,,,,,""""""
perks that come with being the mother of a,,,,,,,,,,""""""

a magnificent apartment. And perhaps a car,,,,,,,,,,""""""
and free parking.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I hate and despise you and everything you,,,,,,,,,,""""""
stand for with all my heart and soul. I,,,,,,,,,,""""""
could never forgive what you've done to me,,,,,,,,,,""""""

JANOSZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Many marriages begin with a certain amount,,,,,,,,,,""""""

the canvas.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VIGO,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Soon my life begins. Then woe to the weak,,,,,,,,,,""""""
all power to me, the world is mine.,,,,,,,,,""""""
INT. MUSEUM - JANOSZ - NIGHT,,,,,,,,,,""""""
The baby's body begins to glow as Vigo reaches out for it. Then suddenly,,,,,,,,,,""""""
a dark shadow falls across the skylight. Janosz looks up.,,,,,,,,,,""""""

Janosz retreats from the shower of broken glass as the Ghostbusters come,,,,,,,,,,""""""

Janosz steps in front of the painting.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SPENGLER,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Hi there. Feel free to try something stupid.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Janosz sneers, trusting the invincibility of Vigo.,,,,,,,,,""""""
JANOSZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
You pitiful, miserable creatures! You dare,,,,,,,,,""""""
to challenge the power of darkness? Don't,,,,,,,,,,""""""
you realize what you are dealing with? He's,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Vigo! You are like the buzzing of flies to,,,,,,,,,,""""""
him.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(sighs),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Oh, Johnny. Did you back the wrong horse.,,,,,,,,,""""""
With that, the Ghostbusters fire their slime-blowers and hose Janosz from,,,,,,,,,""""""
head to toe, blowing him into the corner. Then they turn to Vigo.,,,,,,,,,""""""
VIGO,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He is now almost completely out of the painting, but still held from the,,,,,,,,,""""""
knees down. He spits and rages at the Ghostbusters, trying to unleash,,,,,,,,,""""""
his magic powers.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
THE GHOSTBUSTERS,,,,,,,,,,""""""
They stand fast, secure in the knowledge that Vigo's power has been,,,,,,,,,""""""
neutralized by the good will of the people.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad,,,,,,,,""""""
little monkey.,,,,,,,,,,""""""

The whole city's together on this one. We,,,,,,,,,,""""""
took a vote. Everybody's down on you, you,,,,,,,,,""""""

WINSTON,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(arming his slime-blower),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Say goodnight now.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Suddenly Vigo grabs Stantz by the neck and holds him up as a shield.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SPENGLER,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Don't shoot! You'll hit Ray!,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""

Winston wipes the slime off Ray's face and Ray opens his eyes.,,,,,,,,,,""""""

Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(smiles lovingly),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Groovy. I've never felt better in my life.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Oh, no. We've got to live with this?,,,,,,,,,""""""
They pull him to his feet.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I love you guys. You're the best friends,,,,,,,,,,""""""
I've ever had.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
He hugs them each in turn, leaving them slimed as well. Venkman recoils,,,,,,,,,""""""
in disgust.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Hey, I just had this suit cleaned.,,,,,,,,,""""""
(indicating Janosz),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Take care of the wiggler, will you.,,,,,,,,,""""""
Venkman crosses to Dana who is snuggling the baby. She hugs Venkman.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
What is this -- a love in?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(notes the symbols painted,,,,,,,,,,""""""
on the baby's body),,,,,,,,,,""""""
Hey, sailor. I think the tattoos are a,,,,,,,,,""""""
little much, don't you?,,,,,,,,,""""""
He picks up the baby.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
DANA,,,,,,,,,,""""""

I think he likes you. I think I do too.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Finally came to your senses, huh?,,,,,,,,,""""""
They hug and kiss.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
SPENGLER, WINSTON AND STANTZ,,,,,,,,,""""""

JANOSZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""

What happened?,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""

Sir, you had a violent, prolonged,,,,,,,,""""""

It's where you want to be.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
As they exit they stop to examine the painting that was concealed by,,,,,,,,,,""""""

SPENGLER,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Late Renaissance, I think. Caravaggio or,,,,,,,,,""""""

WINSTON,,,,,,,,,,""""""
(staring at it),,,,,,,,,,""""""
There's something very familiar about this,,,,,,,,,,""""""
painting.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
INT. MUSEUM - NEW PAINTING - NIGHT,,,,,,,,,,""""""
It's a beautiful painting in the high-Renaissance style depicting four,,,,,,,,,,""""""
archangels hovering protectively over a cherubic baby. One holds a harp,,,,,,,,,,""""""

VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""
Oh, right, you told me that. They came to,,,,,,,,""""""
America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I,,,,,,,,,""""""
recall. How about you, Winston?,,,,,,,,,""""""
WINSTON,,,,,,,,,,""""""
My people weren't taking any pictures from,,,,,,,,,,""""""

Same difference.,,,,,,,,,,""""""
STANTZ,,,,,,,,,,""""""
What's your story, Pete?,,,,,,,,,""""""
VENKMAN,,,,,,,,,,""""""

A mem'ry of our walk of love
In a dream, a stream goes by
Reflecting a message from the sky above
And here and there we look around
To see other lovers who have found
Their way
Crickets tap out their symphony in code;
Rabbits run helter skelter finding shelter here
And flowers swaying in the breeze
Look up to the branches of the trees
And sing as birds take wing
All this is true 'cause I love you"""

So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you, need you
Outside I'm masquerading
Inside my hope is fading
Just a clown oh yeah
Since you put me down
My smile is my make up
I wear since my break up with you
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears"""

Pen house suit got the flashing lights
I don't give a fuck if my album drops
I'm a platinum in the streets I've got a thousand shots
All I do is make money I don't chase women
Hopped out the coup ten chains swinging
Chill on my block build a paper plane
I'm in the streets to race, no sega game
Everyday is the same, they changed the name
But I'm still slanging up in taylor's lane
I'm the club with a strally on my waist line
Holds 12 but is guaranteed to spray nine
They wanna know when the mix-tapes coming out
While I'm hoping these bricks ain't running out
Filling out the clientèle, giving out free yays
Stepping on the powder, cocaine dj'ing
Moving keys but I keep loosing p's
And I hardly get high cah I'm immune to cheese
My p's going up and down like sand in an hour glass
Call me Mr Burns I'm the man with the power-plant
I'll be chilling with my young bucks
30K on my neck, swinging like some nun-chucks
Chilling on the strip bait, but I'm out here spending like at this rate
I got the Nina I don't lift weights
I paint pictures, I'm nice with the words
The only thing cheap about me is the price on them words
Close your eyes when I get in the zone
Got a quarter 'mil line this ain't a regular phone,
They be watching my p's, I'm stocked up with cheese
It stinks so I gotta spray my block with febreeze
If them hoes ever see how I knock off them keys
When I tell them give me brain they will drop to their knees
Go over seas, get my mind straight
Left my workers with a line and 2 keys, something light weight
Certified trap-star, I ain't gotta say it
And I don't ever see the food, I let my shotters weigh it
Hoes looking at the pinky when I change gears
I'm out here moving onions, these ain't tears
With the AK, ill hit you up from long range
Got my weight up, a couple friends have gone strange
Just spend 7G's to make a 1000 back
My neighbours see them birds flying out the trap
Get your facts straight before you diss my team
And I ain't got a girlfriend, I sold that bitch a dream
Lord forgive me, I done a lot of dirt
I break down keys so this rap shit ain't gotta work
I stay on my grind, my work rate great
Tell a bitch if she ain't fucking on the first date skate
Them hoes are pinging but I ain't replying
Cah my phone keeps ringing, I'm always supplying
If I go pen, I'm shooting grade on the wing
And its looking like I spilled lucozade on my ring
5 bricks gone in one day, I trap hard
The mix-tape got more bangers than a scrap yard
Whoever thought I'd me moving these bricks
Copped a Q then I blew like a Crip
Must be crazy if you think my jewels are fake
Every time my phone rings I'm loosing weight
Its like I gotta ride out on my jack jones
Cah man ah keep talk bait on the tapped phones
I don't care about views on the net
Hands on cah my workers ain't moving correct
Heavy jewels on my neck, so I cruise with a tech
And if I pull it out, I'll leave your goons on the deck
Ask about me, I've been in birds view
Still hungry like the day I bought my first Q
Times have changed if them paigans have switched sex
I sold a billion O's but I ain't rich yet
Chilling on my block, bare clowns about
They werent around when I was in the bookie, down and out
Happy when I went broke and I had to consign a 7
How you like me now? I pull up in a 9/11
I ain't made a wack song yet
Told my youngers to put me a chain, stacks on deck
Im A'Jd out, used to wear denim clothes
Niggas thought ill never blow when I started selling draws
Wrapping out all night im soo knackered
Me and lil T, united like Old Trafford
With my delivery, if I was in this industry id clearly sell
But im caught up in this scary world, ain't no fairy tale"""

I have visions of many things
But happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion

Some kind of peace of mind
Maybe

The roots of love grow all around
But for me they come a tumblin' down
Every day heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer

I walk in shadows searching for light
Cold and alone no comfort in sight
Hoping and praying for someone to care
Always moving and going nowhere

Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind

I'm searching though I don't succeed
But someone look, there's a growing need
All is lost, there's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending

Now what becomes of the broken-hearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind

Just to find someone to care

Nothing's gonna stop me now

Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd change the world for the good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down
When a man loves a woman
He'll spend his very last dime
Tryin' to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way
It ought to be
Well, this man loves you, woman
I gave you everything I had
Tryin' to hold on to your heartless love
Baby, please don't treat me bad
When a man loves a woman
Down deep in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she is playin' him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Lovin' eyes can never see
When a man loves a woman
He can do her no wrong
He can never want
Some other girl
Yes when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
Cause baby, baby, you're my world

With flowers and my love, both never to come back

Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day
I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black
No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue

I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by
The flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"", said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words, like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said:
""The words of the prophets are
Written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sound of silence."""""

He sings each night in some cafe
In his search to find wealth and fame
I hear Michael has gone and changed his name
It's a year since he wasn't here
Kentucky blue bird, fly away
And take a message to Michael
Message to Michael
Tell him I miss him more each day
As his train pulled out down the track
Michael promised he'd soon be coming back
Oh tell him how my heart just breaks in two
Since he journeyed far
And even though his dream of fame
Fell through
To me he will always be a star
Spread your wings for New Orleans

Rich or poor

For every single thrill, there's another heartache
The road is rough
The going gets tough

Yes, love is a hurtin' thing
Oh, love is a hurtin' thing

When you're in my arms, I'm a king on a throne
But when we're apart, I walk the streets alone
On one day, happiness
The next day, loneliness

Love is a hurtin' thing
Oh, love is a hurtin' thing

When love brings so much joy, why must it bring such pain?
Guess it's a mystery that nobody can explain

Maybe I'm a fool to keep on loving you
'Cause there may come a time you'll break my heart in two
But I want you so
I want you, though I know that

And mama said to me, ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?
I've been cookin' all morning, and you haven't touched a single bite
That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today
Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way
He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge
And she and Billie Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""
A year has come and gone since we heard the news 'bout Billie Joe
And brother married Becky Thompson; they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round; papa caught it, and he died last spring
And now mama doesn't seem to want to do much of anything
And me - I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge"""

First and foremost, Gaye was a Christian artist. He was also one of the most gifted performers produced by the Afro-American religious experience. Raised in his father's Pentecostal church, located in the East Capitol projects in Washington, D.C., Gaye was imbued with a deep spiritual sensitivity anchored in a Christ-centered ethic of love. Initially this sensitivity was expressed in his instrumental virtuosity -- especially on the organ, piano, and drums. Althought Gaye sang in the church choir, his vocal talent did not surface until he filled the first-tenor slot of Harvey Fuqua's Moonglows, a smooth-harmony rhythm and blues group. When Gaye's silky and soulful voice caught the attention of Berry Gordy, Jr. -- the founder of Motown Recording Company -- in a Detroit nightclub in 1961, he was immediately offered a contract. The public career of Marvin Gaye had begun.
Motown was the Jackie Robinson of black popular music: after crossing the color line it its field, it went on to excel and to win the hearts of vast numbers of nonblack Americans. As with other Motown stars -- Diana Ross, Lionel Richie and Michael Jackson -- Gaye's relationship with Motown enabled his talent to become visible to the world. Unlike those other artists, Gaye's musical and philosophical roots remained in the Afro-American Christian tradition. His first classic recordings were neither adolescent, rhythmic dance records (as with the Supremes and the Jackson Five) nor funky rock renderings (as with Lionel Richie's Commodores). Rather, Gaye's great early achievements -- sung with the incomparable Tammi Terrell -- were poignant and powerful love songs, written by the team of Nickolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson of White Rock Baptist Church in New York City. These classics -- such as ""Your Precious Love,"" ""Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing,"" ""You're All I Need to Get By"" and ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" -- were the pivotal songs that directed the Christian relgiosity of black church music into the secular spirituality of Afro-American popular music. For the first time in American history, the musical depth of the black church was let loose into the mainstream of American society. And American popular music would never again be the same.
Upon the tragic death of Tammi Terrell, who collapsed in Gaye's arms during a performance in 1967, Gaye went into hiding. Despite his success as a solo performer (""I'll Be Doggone,"" ""Ain't That Peculiar,"" and ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine"" all reached the Top Ten), Gaye became reclusive, melancholic and deeply dissatisfied with his music. He would not perform publicly for five years.
""WHAT'S GOING ON""
Yet Gaye's tortuous struggle with the sudden death of Tammi Terrell, his younger brother Frankie's firsthand accounts of atrocities in Vietnam, the escalation of the civil rights movement into black power advocacy, the widespread invasion of drugs among unemployed black youth and the rise of ecological consciousness produced the greatest album in Afro-American popular music: What's Going On (1971). This groundbreaking album was not only the first conceived and enacted by the artist (as opposed to studio staffers), but also the first concept album that hung together by means of a set of themes -- themes concerned with socio-economic critique and Christian outlook.
Gaye's critique of American society was explicit. ""Rockets, moon shots,"" he wrote in ""Inner City Blues,"" ""Spend it on the have-nots."" With ""radiation underground and in the sky,"" he saw birds and animals dying in ""Mercy, Mercy Me (The Ecology)."" Instead of brutality, he asked attention: ""Talk to me, so you can see"" (""What's Going On""). And in such songs as ""Save the Children,"" ""God Is Love"" and ""Wholly Holy,"" he explicitly evoked the love ethic of Jesus Christ as the basis for negating and transforming the world: If we learn from the book jesus left us, we can rock the world, we can ""holler love across the nation.""
What's Going On was the peak of Gaye's career. He continued to produce popular albums and hits. Yet, principally owing to two painful divorces, Oedipal obsessions, paranoiac fits and suicidal impulses, Gaye became captive to a form of bondage he admonished others to avoid: drugs. His songs still portrayed a longing for transcendence, but instead of the agapic praxis of communities he highlighted erotic communion -- as in his albums Let's Get It On (1973) and I Want You and his Grammy Award single ""Sexual Healing"" (1982).
In his last years, Gaye oscillated between earthly pessimism and eschatological hope: from the notion that nuclear holocaust was imminent to a faith that only Jesus can save us. During his sporadic bouts with suicide, Gaye is reported to have viewed Jesus and sins that would never be forgiven as the primary motivations to live. And, at the height of this turmoil, the last words he wrote for his laste album, Midnight Love (1982), were ""I still love Jesus, all praises to the Heavenly Father."" May this troubled musical genius, deeply immersed in the Afro-American religious experience and genuinely sensitive to the harsh realities of American society, rest in peace. And may his artistic Christian witness live forever."""

Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kinda seasick
But the crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale


She said, there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might have just as well've been closed

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale


She said, 'I'm home on shore leave,'
Though in truth we were at sea
So I took her by the looking glass
And forced her to agree
Saying, 'You must be the mermaid
Who took Neptune for a ride.'
But she smiled at me so sadly
That my anger straightway died

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

If music be the food of love
Then laughter is its queen
And likewise if behind is in front
Then dirt in truth is clean
My mouth by then like cardboard
Seemed to slip straight through my head
So we crash-dived straightway quickly
And attacked the ocean bed

And so it was that later

That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale"""

The harps of the bards are silenced; the warriors are ranged in two long files; the gates of the palace are flung open, and the aged Morna appears between his two sons, Lémor and Armin. The
p. 151
people flock to gaze on their king, and welcome him with acclamations of deep affection, because Morna is the well beloved of all, as his name signifies in the harmonious language of the verdant isles. The hair and beard of the king are white, but the snow of seventy winters has been powerless to bend the limbs of the athlete king, well developed by labour and a sober life. The loving people have also a welcome for the princes who accompany the ancient, for beautiful in body and soul are Lémor and Armin. Lémor possesses a face that is fair to behold as the snow which crowns the heights of Carmora; his hair is golden as the rays of the sun, and his eyes are blue like the flower of the flax. They depart from Témora, followed by the warriors and blessed by the women. The old men and the children gaze after their retreating forms with loving eyes and hearts until they become lost in the woods of Lena. But they are not proceeding to war--no--for see, the women do not weep on beholding their departure. The wild boar, of rough skin and long tusks, is the enemy against which they are going to wrestle in the forests of Lena. See them as they become lost in the fastnesses as soon as the dogs announce the presence of the giant of the woods. The king goes one way, and Lémor and Armin go another. The bugle of the keepers also announce the appearance of the wild boar. And the boar runs, runs, runs, destroying with his formidable
p. 152
tusks every dog which dares to approach him, repelling all the arrows directed against his hard rough skin. Lémor has separated himself from his brother as he had done previously from his father, and one hour had already been spent by the tired-out huntsmen in scouring the dense wood unable to vanquish the boar. The bugle announces to Lémor that the animal is running towards where he is, and the gallant huntsman prepares his bow. The tangled brushwood is seen moving at a short distance from him; the enormous head of the boar is descried, and the arrow of Lémor pierces the air. A cry of pain is heard, and Lémor hastens to despatch the animal; but the boar is not in the spot aimed at by the arrow, and the cry of pain is repeated some distance further. Lémor advances, and on separating the tangled growth of briars and brushwood behind which issued the wail, a cry of immense sorrow bursts from his breast on seeing that his father, the king of the green isles, the beloved of all, and of none more than of Lémor, is lying on the ground in a dying condition, his noble breast pierced by the dart shot from the bow of Lémor. Lémor beseeches help for his father, invoking the protection of heaven in behalf of the dying old man endeavours to return back his life--that life which is fast ebbing away--and he weeps on seeing his impotence, and his soul is filled with despair.
p. 153
II.
They are returning to the palace of Témora, the princes of the Emerald Isles, and the warriors who went with them to the woods of Lena; but the bards who went out to receive them, when they perceived them returning in the far distance, do not strike their golden harps, nor do they welcome the huntsmen with songs of praise. Silent and sorrowful do the huntsmen and the bards arrive, and on learning the cause of this silence and grief the women and the old men and the children fill the air with their laments and their wails of sorrow. Morna, the beloved of all, returns, a lifeless body, conducted by his warriors, laid on a litter of funereal cypress, and Lémor and Armin appear to be dying of grief. The ancients, the chieftains of the tribes of Erin, assemble together on the following day in Témora, and after a long conference they come and stand before Lémor, the heir to the sovereignty of the Emerald Isles.
""Prince,"" spoke the oldest of the chiefs, ""although by our laws a parricide is condemned to death, thou must not die, because, if thine arrow did wound thy father, it was not done willingly; but the crown must not be placed on the brow of one who is stained with the blood of his father and of his king, nor can he dwell amongst us. The crown of Morna must rest on the stainless
p. 154
brow of Armin. To-morrow at daybreak a ship will await thee in port provisioned and manned. Depart in her for ever from our isles, and may heaven protect thee wheresoever the wind and wave may take thee to!""
Lémor accedes to the decision of the chieftains of the tribes, and delivers himself up to the mercy of the winds and of the waves, with no better company than his own sorrow, his hope in heaven which knew his innocence, and two loyal servitors who had willed to share his misfortunes.
The ship, deficient of a skilful pilot, sailed on for days and nights and even months upon the boundless solitudes of the ocean, cast about like a toy at the mercy of swelling waves and the fury of the winds. Thirst at length begins to parch up Lémor and his servitors, who have no more water to drink or to cool their parched lips but the salt sea water. But just as the last ray of hope of discovering land had been extinguished, and they had abandoned all idea of meeting with the shore of any country whatever, they perceived in the far distance, amid the sea mists, a coast backed by green mountains, and they pushed on their ship towards that blessed land. That land was the one inhabited by the Cantabrians, 1 the race of giants which, five centuries
p. 155
earlier, Rome, the mistress of the world, had been unable to vanquish despite all her power.
The ship is closely approaching the shore. Beautiful is the land before them; more beautiful even than the isles of Erin is the continent which the prince and his loyal servitors hail with joy. The exiles leap from the ship on to the land and burst out in shouts of joy, because beneath the shade of some immense leafy chestnut trees they perceive a fountain of running water, clear as the crystalline roofs of the grottoes of Drumanar. The fresh water calms the heat which devours them. Peace comes over the soul, and sleep visits their weary eyelids. They cast themselves on a green slope covered with flowers, and soon fall asleep.
III.
Where goes the echeco-jauna 1 of Bustuna as he abandons the cultivation of his fields and descends to the deserted shores of Mundaca, followed by those who were assisting him at his work? Where goes the echeco-jauna in such haste?
From the mountain heights he has seen a little ship tossed by the waves and dashing itself against the rocks, and, as his heart is compassionate and hospitable he runs, flies to succour the wrecked ones whom he
p. 156
supposes must be battling with death on the shore. He stops as he descends to the plain, and those who came with him also. Three strangers are sleeping close to the fountain under the shade of the chestnut trees, and the echeco-jauna remains there in order to watch over and guard their steep.
The sons of the green isles awake, and they ask of the echeco-jauna what land that is which the winds and the waves have brought them to in their ship. And on learning that it is the land of the invincible Cantabrians, they raise their lips to heaven and thank God for having conducted them to the country of the first heroes of the universe. Under the roof of Bustuna they find an hospitable asylum, those exiles from Erin; but very quickly does it become known throughout the Euskarian mountains that among them dwells a son of kings, and the aged Lekobide, the chieftain of the Eskaldunac, 1 and descendant of the glorious leader of the same name who humbled the pride of the Cæsars, and whom the Basque people sing praises in their songs, sends messengers to the Prince of Erin to offer him a home in the valley of Padura.
p. 157
Lémor contemplates with delight the supreme happiness of the land on reaching the dwelling of the Basque chieftain. An aureole of glory encircles the venerable brow of Lekobide, and another of beauty and chastity that of the youthful Luz, the daughter of the chieftain of the Eskaldunac.
Months have passed since Lémor came to dwell in the home of Lekobide, and for months has he been striving to quit the valley of Padura, because as a good knight and a good Christian he is ashamed to live in idleness meanwhile that the sons of Agar are trampling on the holy cross beyond the Ebro. For months has he wished to offer his arm to Fernan Gonzalez, the Count de Castile, but he is always held back by the pleadings of Luz and Lekobide; and, more than all, is he detained by a mysterious power which dwells in his heart. Warlike exercises and the chase restrains his steps. When departing from Padura he wends his steps towards the lofty mountains that command the view of the valley to pursue the wild boar and the deer, Luz goes to the window with saddened looks to watch the stranger from the valley, and the stranger turns back seeking Luz at the window.
IV.
The Eskaldunac are free, free as the breeze and the birds of their mountains. They have no lord to whom
p. 158
they owe vassalage, nor do they possess other laws than those written in the consciences of their chiefs, who judge the culprit and adjust contentions under the shadow of the holy tree of Guernica. Beyond the hierarchy of virtue and of intelligence and of age, there is but one hierarchy in the land of the Eskaldunac. The Eskaldunac elect a chief who is ever ready to lead them to the combat whenever the stranger invades their free land; and this glorious title they bestowed on Lekobide more than half a century before in consideration of his virtue, his intelligence, his valour, and his glorious name.
One day, when the Euskaro patricians were assembled together under the holy oak of Guernica, one of them remarked that Lekobide was aged and impotent, and therefore incapable to take the command of the armies of the Eskaldunac on the day when the stranger should invade the land. Then a patrician of a century old spoke in the name of the assembly:
""Fifteen years have passed since Leyalá, the most valiant and loyal dog of our mountains, watched day and night at the door of his master. ""Leyalá is old,"" said one day the echeco-jauna, and on that night a new guardian was installed in the post in which Leyalá had grown old.
""The fox which had been scared away from afar by Leyalá fifteen years ago, and which he had scented
p. 159
from a great distance, came that very night, unfelt by the young dog, and ate up the fowls of the echeco-jauna. And Leyalá, who, sad and broken in heart, had left the fern-bed in which he had slept for fifteen years at the door of the homestead, in order that a stranger should occupy his post, was found dead on the following morning, although the echeco-jauna had prepared a bed for him softer and more sheltered than the one in which he had lain for fifteen years.""
Thus spoke the patrician of a century old, and since then no one ever remarked that Lekobide was aged. Neither Lekobide himself remembered his age, because the youthfulness of his spirit does not permit him to think on the age of his strong arm.
But hark! a low rumour is heard, and an unusual agitation unknown for years spreads across the valleys and along the range of the Basque mountains, and numerous scouts, their hearts full of indignation, hasten to the door of Lekobide, calling out--
""Quidaria! 1 a formidable army appears on the cordillera of Orduña, and alas! for the Eskaldunac, should the irrinzi 2 not be quickly heard on our mountains.
Lekobide rises up brimming over with wrath. ""Blow the five bugle-horns on the five Basque mountains; for
p. 160
none must reach the Tree Malato of those who would dare in warfare to trample down our free dwellings! Give me my coat of mail, and the lance which seventy years ago accompanied me to the combat!"" And Lekobide quickly puts on the coat of mail, and his body bends beneath the weight of his armour. Lekobide grasps the lance, but his arm is powerless to hold it. Then does the glorious chieftain remember his age and trembles; and, humbled and despairing, he falls down at the threshold of the door.
Meanwhile the alarm flies along the Basque mountains and valleys, and in answer to the call to war many Basque warriors are coming down to the valley of Padura, imploring their revered chieftain to lead them to battle. A ray of hope suddenly illumines the venerable countenance of Lekobide which had been so full of despair.
""Prince of Erin cried the old man, addressing the son of Morna, ""take my coat of mail and my lance, and fill my place of command at the head of the Euskaro legions!""
""Señor!"" replies Lémor, ""I will fight against the enemies of thy land in which I have received such generous hospitality, but it will be in the soldier's ranks. Seek a chieftain more worthy than I to lead thy warriors to the combat.""
All the Euscarian warriors who had descended from
p. 161
the mountains to the valley of Padura joined their pleadings to those of Lekobide, but the modest Prince of Erin insists on marching to war only on condition of fighting. in the ranks with the humblest wrestler.
""As long as thou livest, thou wilt be the leader and champion of the Eskaldunac, because I am powerless to be so,"" said Lekobide, with universal assent; but Lémor still continues to refuse to accept the glorious title offered to him.
""Thou art the son of kings, and art worthy to command vassals,"" exclaim the ancients of the twenty valleys gathered together in the valley of Padura; ""the free land of the Euskaro confers upon thee the sovereignty if thou dost consent to take the command of our armies.""
The prince of the green isles refuses the sovereignty of the Eskaldunac. And while all this contention takes place, more scouts appear on the field to announce that the army of the enemy has passed the Tree Malato, and are descending the mountain slopes, like a raging sea, carrying all that opposes its progress.
""Oh, Prince of Erin!"" cries Lekobide, ""if in my veins flowed the blood of kings I would then tell thee--Lead the Eskaldunac legions on to battle, cast out of our free land the stranger, and on returning from the combat thou wilt sit at my hearth, and I will bestow on thee the title of son!""
p. 162
Lémor directed a glance full of love and hope towards Luz; and, as though he had read on the brow of the maiden the reply his soul yearned to hear, he cried out, as he donned the coat of mail and grasped the lance of Lekobide:
""Old man! may God permit me to be seated at thy hearth and hear from thy lips the name of son!""
V.
Upon the five highest mountains of the free land is heard the blast of the trumpets, and that warlike sound is answered throughout the valleys and mountains by the powerful irrinzi. Every man with sufficient strength to cast an arrow, wield the sword, the lance, or battleaxe, speedily rises up, quits his house, and proceeds toward the valley of Padura, whose plains and heights can scarcely hold the thousands of Basques that are collecting together in answer to the call of their Country. This call or summons is not issued without good cause, for the enemies are many, and they are already approaching the valley of Padura as though to challenge the chieftain, who they are well aware dwells there.
The armies which invade the Basque mountains are not composed of those brave legions of Castile and Leon, who so often planted the cross of Christ over the tents of the Mussulman; nor are they led by the kings
p. 163
of Leon or the Counts of Castile. These legions are composed of low adventurers, who defame the Christian name from the banks of the Ebro to the shores of the Tagus, and are commanded by Ordoño the Wicked, the vile usurper of the crown of Sancho el Craso, and who, cast forth from his Leonese throne, wishes to drown his disappointment in the noble blood of the Eskaldunac, and raise up on the Basque mountains a new throne upon which to sit.
The Basque army, led by Jaun-Zuria, as the people style the Prince of Erin, goes out to encounter the stranger, who is already appearing on the mountain heights that overlook the valley of Padura, and Sancho de Esteguiz, the lord of the Duranguesado, leaves his palace of Tarisa to lead the Duranguese, who are longing to fight by the side of their brother tribes, commanded by the prince. The combat is a fierce one, and its frightful din thunders throughout the hitherto peaceful mountains of the Euskaros. A dense cloud of arrows obscures the sunlight, enormous boulders of rocks wrenched by the herculean arms of the Eskaldunac are cast upon the armies of Ordoño, dismembering and crushing and terrifying them. The axe and the lance, the swords of the Basque warriors are fast cutting down the invading legions on the broken rocks of Padura. But the desperation of Ordoño incites him to make a supreme effort to reanimate
p. 164
the courage of the adventurers, and the victory is still undecided.
""Death to the leader of the Eskaldunac!"" cries Ordoño, ""and then the victory will be ours!"" And he runs to encounter Jaun-Zuria, who at the same time fights, and commands his army in the thickest of the fray.
The son of the kings of Erin goes out in his turn to meet the ambitious chief of the invaders, and closes with him in a fierce match. The lance of Lekobide, wielded with Titanic force by the Prince of Erin, pierces through the breast of Ordoño, who expires uttering a roar of desperation which resounds throughout the mountains of Padura like that of a wounded lion. But alas! a stone flung by the enemy wounds the noble forehead of the lord of the Duranguesado, for whose life the Prince of Erin would willingly have given his own!
Disorder reigns now in the disbanded legions of the stranger, and they flee in terror back from whence they came, marking their footprints with blood and fire. The Eskaldunac follow them to the cordillera of Ordoño, and there, wearied with so much slaughter, and beholding their country once more happy and free, they return to rest and to celebrate their glorious triumph beneath the shades of the Tree Malato.
p. 165
VI.
Nearly ten centuries have passed since the Eskaldunac, led by the exile of Erin, sent a thrill of joy and triumph among the people on the fields of Padura. Should you desire to visit these fields, do not seek on the map for the name of Padura, because they have changed this name for that of Arrigorriaga, which in the rich and venerable language of the Euskaro is equivalent to reddened stones. The rocks which bristle on the tops of the mountains of the ancient Padura presented for a long time the colour of the blood which the hordes of Ordoño the Wicked poured upon them, and for this reason was the ancient name of Padura altered to that of Arrigorriaga.
Proceed to the parochial church of the valley of Arrigorriaga, and there, close to the font of holy water, you will see a sepulchre. Ask the simple villager who it is that reposes in that sepulchre, and he will tell you that there lies a prince called Ordoño, who strove to rob the Basque people of their liberties, and was killed by Jaun-Zuria, the first Lord of Biscay. After this, examine the dusty archives of the temple, and if you understand the changeless and eternal language of the Eskaldunac, you may read in some worm-eaten parchments, yellowed by age, that in this temple were joined together the daughter of Lekobide with the son of a King of Erin."""

—Sade, “Pearls”
 Never believe that a few caring people can't change the world.
For, indeed, that's all who ever have.
—Margaret Mead
I will donate all of my proceeds from The Hard Thing About Hard Things to American Jewish World Service to support their efforts to help women fight for their basic rights throughout the world.
Since there are many important causes, I thought that it would be worth explaining why I am supporting this one.
When I was 11 years old, I was exposed to chronic cruelty on a global scale. I watched the miniseries “Roots” based on Alex Haley's bestselling novel about slavery in the United States. I was riveted and horrified. It was my first real introduction to slavery and I could not believe what I was seeing. I saw families broken apart as they were sold to different owners. I saw slaves pleading for their lives only to be brutalized and killed. How could anybody be so cruel? How could everybody sit by and watch it happen? How was this even possible? I could not have been more shocked.
I was deeply disturbed by the whole experience and sought to find out how it happened. I studied humankind's long history with slavery. I learned that in the 1600s, 75% of the world's population was enslaved. I learned that the Caribbean form of the African slave trade was far more brutal than the U.S. version. I studied the complex economics of slavery and why it was difficult to unwind once started. I began to wonder how slavery ever ended.
Then I began to study the abolitionists. Men like former slave ship captain John Newton who later wrote the song “Amazing Grace”. People like the great Thomas Clarkson who at times seemed to be alone in taking on the world. I learned how a few unimaginably brave people took on the entire globe and its brutal institution. They did not care about the twisted history or corrupt cultures that created slavery. They just wanted it stopped. Clarkson took great personal risk in traveling by boat back and forth across the Atlantic to record and tell the story of slavery for no reason other than he wanted it ended. He dedicated his life to stopping the cruelty. His story is among the most inspirational in human history.
It had to be, because the most incredible thing about slavery was how it ended. An institution that was embedded into human culture, endorsed by the Bible, promoted by the Qur’an, pervasive in society, and embedded in the global economy was taken on and defeated by a movement started by a tiny number of people. These brave souls had no Twitter or Facebook. They had no Internet or telephones or automobiles, but they organized people across the world and largely stopped slavery globally.
After understanding how slavery ended, I promised myself that if something like that ever happened in my time, I would be part of the group who tried to stop it.
Sadly, something like slavery is happening in my time. It's not happening in the United States, but it is happening and the victims are women. In many parts of the world, women are literally owned by men. Women do not enjoy basic rights, are denied access to education, can be arbitrarily raped, robbed, and killed, and live in fear with no chance for self-determination. A few revealing statistics:
- Every year 10 million girls under the age 18 enter into early and forced marriages
- 2 million girls a year undergo genital cutting
- Two-thirds of the world's illiterate adults are women
- Women constitute about 70% of the world’s absolute poor (i.e., those living on less than a dollar a day)
Meanwhile, the rhetoric deployed in resistance to women's rights is eerily reminiscent of resistance to freeing slaves. Consider this statement from the Muslim Brotherhood in resistance to a U.N. declaration calling for an end to violence against women:
This declaration, if ratified, would lead to complete disintegration of society, and would certainly be the final step in the intellectual and cultural invasion of Muslim countries, eliminating the moral specificity that helps preserve cohesion of Islamic societies.
And compare it to this poem written in defense of slavery in England in 1789:
If our slave trade had gone, there's an end to our lives
Beggars all we must be, our children and wives
No ships from our ports, their proud sails e'er would spread,
And our streets grown with grass where the cows might be fed.
Like Thomas Clarkson and the abolitionists, Ruth Messinger and AJWS are starting at the grass roots level, but are already making great progress.
Consider Rehana Adib. At age 12, she was raped by a group of older relatives. She bravely told her father, but he responded by arranging for her to marry a middle-aged man—a match designed to protect her security and reputation. Like many other girls her age, she was forced to drop out of school and was expected to be a subservient wife and mother. She was not free to make choices about her daily life and her own future.
But Rehana refused to be silent. She found a women’s organization in her neighborhood and began to learn about her rights. She took workshops in leadership and activism and gained the courage to speak out about her experiences. By the time Rehana was 18, she was an active member of the local women’s movement and was already helping other girls overcome the challenges they faced. Although her family and community criticized her work at first, she slowly gained their respect and is now looked to as a leader in her community.
In 2005, Rehana founded her own organization, Astitva, in Muzzafarnagar—a rural area in Uttar Pradesh, India. With AJWS’s support, Astitva works today to stop both sexual violence and child marriage, helping give girls a chance at a brighter future.
The systematic cultural abuse of women worldwide must end. Let’s end it.

Came a roar and a thunder men had never heard

Eighty men tried, and eighty men died
Now they're buried together on the countryside

Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty or more
The Bloody Red Baron was rolling out the score
Eighty men died trying to end that spree
Of the Bloody Red Baron of Germany

In the nick of time, a hero arose
A funny-looking dog with a big black nose
He flew into the sky to seek revenge
But the Baron shot him down (Curses, foiled again!)


Now, Snoopy had sworn that he'd get that man
So he asked the Great Pumpkin for a new battle plan
He challenged the German to a real dogfight
While the Baron was laughing, he got him in his sight

Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Some say it's a sign of weakness
For a man to beg
Then weak I'd rather be
If it means havin' you to keep
'Cause lately I've been losin' sleep
Baby, I need your lovin'
I got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Empty nights
Echo your name
Sometimes I wonder
Will I ever be the same
Oh yeah, when you see me smile
You know
Things have gotten worse
Any smile you might see
Has all been rehearsed
Darlin', I can't go on without you
This emptiness won't let me live without you
This loneliness inside me, darlin'
Makes me feel not alive, honey
Baby, I need your lovin'
I got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
I got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'"""

(Wait a second)
You're gone now
I run to touch you, but you vanish through the doorway
And, oh, how
Hard it is to live without you
I love everything about you
Now I know you're really gone
But my imagination is so strong
That I see you coming into view
And your face is telling me that you
Oh, yeah, oh, want to be by my side
Oh, yeah, oh, now it's finally time
(Wait a second)
Mirage, that's all you are to me
Mirage, something I only see
So I keep walking through the alleys and the hallways
Where are you?
I keep remembering the kissing in the doorways
The car, too
How it all comes back to me
The movies every Saturday
The place we used to go to eat
I want so much to have it like it used to be
That I see you coming into view
And your face is telling me that you
Oh, yeah, oh, want to be by my side
Oh, yeah, oh, now it's finally time
(Here it comes again)
Mirage, that's all you are to me
Mirage, something I only see
Just a mirage, that's all you are to me
Just a mirage, something that I only see
Just a mirage, that's all you are to me
Just a mirage, something that I only see"""

As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my Mama and Papa
Down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home
Yes, they'll all come to meet me
Arms reaching, smiling sweetly
It's good to touch the green, green, grass of home
The old house is still standing
Tho' the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home
Yes, they'll all come to meet me
Arms reaching, smiling sweetly
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

Then I awake and look around me
At the four grey walls that surround me
And I realize, yes, I was only dreaming
For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre -
Arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak
Again I touch the green, green grass of home

Yes, they'll all come to see me in the shade
Of that old oak tree
As they lay me neath the green, green grass of home"""
