I know you've deceived me, now here's a surprise
I know that you have cause, there's magic in my eyes
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah
If you think that I don't know about the little tricks you've played
And never see you when deliberately you put things in my way
Well, here's a poke at you
You're going to choke on it too
You're going to lose that smile
Because all the while
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah
You took advantage of my trust in you when I was so far away
I saw you holding lots of other guys and now you've got the nerve to say
That you still want me
Well, that's as may be
But you got to stand trial
Because all the while
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah
{Bridge}
I know you've deceived me, now here's a surprise
I know that you have cause there's magic in my eyes
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah
The Eiffel Tower and the Taj Mahal are mine to see on clear days
You thought that I would need a crystal ball to see right through the haze
Well, here's a poke at you
You're going to choke on it too
You're going to lose that smile
Because all the while
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
And miles and miles and miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles

On your own little cloud
When you don't see the why
Or the wherefore
Ooh, you walk out on me
When we both disagree
'cause to reason is not what you care for
I've heard it all a million times before
Take off your coat, my love, and close the door
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'
Don't stand in the pouring rain
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'
The night is long
Forget your foolish pride
Nothing's wrong
Now you're beside me again
You try to be smart
Then you take it apart
'cause it hurts when your ego is deflated
Um-m-um-um-um-um
You don't realize
That it's all compromise
And the problems are so over-rated
Good-bye means nothing when it's all for show
So why pretend you've somewhere else to go?
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'
Don't stand in the pouring rain
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'
The night is long
Forget your foolish pride
Nothing's wrong

And I don't mean maybe
Nine to five
Ain't takin' me where I'm bound
When it's done
I run out to see my baby
We got groovin'
When the sun goes down
I thank the Lord for the night time
To forget the day
A day of up, uptight time
Baby, chase it away
I get relaxation, it's a time to groove
I thank the Lord for the night time
I thank the Lord for you
I'll talk about plans now
Baby, I got plenty
Nothing ever seems to turn out
The way it should
Talk about money, girl
I ain't got any
Seems like just one time
I'm feeling good
I thank the Lord for the night time
To forget the day
A day of up, uptight time

Blue is my world now I'm without you
Gray, gray, my life is gray
Cold is my heart since you went away
Red, red, my eyes are red
Crying for you alone in my bed
Green, green, my jealous heart
I doubted you and now we're apart
When we met how the bright sun shone
Then love died, now the rainbow is gone
Black, black, the nights I've known
Longing for you so lost and alone"

But friend it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted it, was just a twig
Then the first snow came
And she ran out to brush the snow away
So it wouldn't die
Came runnin' in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself
And I laughed till I cried
She was always young at heart
Kinda dumb and kinda smart and I loved her so
And I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago
And it would sure embarrass her
When I came in from workin' late
Cause I would know
That she'd been sittin' there and cryin'
Over some sad and silly late, late show
And honey, I miss you
And I'm bein' good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could
She wrecked the car and she was sad
And so afraid that I'd be mad
But what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be
Guess you could say she saw through me
And hugged my neck
I came home unexpectedly
And caught her cryin' needlessly
In the middle of the day
And it was in the early Spring
When flowers bloom and robins sing
She went away
And honey, I miss you
And I'm bein' good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could
One day while I was not at home
While she was there and all alone
The angels came
Now all I have is memories of Honey
And I wake up nights and call her name
Now my life's an empty stage
Where Honey lived and Honey played
And love grew up
And a small cloud passes overhead
And cries down on the flower bed
That Honey loved
And see the tree how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big
And I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted it, was just a twig"

Wastin' time

I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the 'Frisco bay
Cause I've had nothing to live for
And look like nothin's gonna come my way

So I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooo, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

Look like nothing's gonna change
Everything still remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same, yes

Sittin' here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's two thousand miles I roamed
Just to make this dock my home

Now, I'm just gonna sit at the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Oooo-wee, sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

A Harper Valley widowed  wife
Who had a teenage daughter
Who attended Harper Valley Junior High
Well her daughter came home one afternoon
And didn't even stop to play
And she said mom, I got a note here from the Harper Valley PTA
Well the note said Mrs. Johnson
You're wearin' your dresses way too high
It's reported you've been drinking
And a-running round with men and goin' wild
And we don't believe you oughta be a-bringin' up
Your little girl this way
And it was signed by the Secretary
Harper Valley PTA
Well, it happened that the PTA was gonna meet
That very afternoon
And they were sure surprised
When Mrs. Johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard
I can still recall the words she had to say
She said I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley PTA
Well there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there
And seven times he asked me for a date
And Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice
Whenever he's away
And Mr. Baker can you tell us why
Your secretary had to leave this town?
And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep
Her window shades all pulled completely down
Well, Mr Harper couldn't be here
'Cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath
You'll find she's had a little nip of gin
And then you have the nerve to tell me
You think that as a mother I'm not fit
Well this is just a little Peyton Place
And you're all Harper Valley hypocrites
No, I wouldn't put you on because it really did

Did you know that probing the seamy underbelly of U.S. lexicography reveals ideological strife and controversy and intrigue and nastiness and fervor on a nearly hanging-chad scale? For instance, did you know that some modern dictionaries are notoriously liberal and others notoriously conservative, and that certain conservative dictionaries were actually conceived and designed as corrective responses to the ""corruption"" and ""permissiveness"" of certain liberal dictionaries? That the oligarchic device of having a special ""Distinguished Usage Panel ... of outstanding professional speakers and writers"" is an attempted compromise between the forces of egalitarianism and traditionalism in English, but that most linguistic liberals dismiss the Usage Panel as mere sham-populism? Did you know that U.S. lexicography even had a seamy underbelly?
The occasion for this article is Oxford University Press's semi-recent release of Bryan A. Garner's A Dictionary of Modern American Usage. The fact of the matter is that Garner's dictionary is extremely good, certainly the most comprehensive usage guide since E. W. Gilman's Webster's Dictionary of English Usage, now a decade out of date. Its format, like that of Gilman and the handful of other great American usage guides of the last century, includes entries on individual words and phrases and expostulative small-cap MINI-ESSAYS. on any issue broad enough to warrant more general discussion. But the really distinctive and ingenious features of A Dictionary of Modern American Usage involve issues of rhetoric and ideology and style, and it is impossible to describe why these issues are important and why Garner's management of them borders on genius without talking about the historical contexts  in which ADMAU appears, and this context turns out to be a veritable hurricane of controversies involving everything from technical linguistics to public education to political ideology, and these controversies take a certain amount of time to unpack before their relation to what makes Garner's usage guide so eminently worth your hard-earned reference-book dollar can even be established; and in fact there's no way even to begin the whole harrowing polymeric discussion without taking a moment to establish and define the highly colloquial term SNOOT.
From one perspective, a certain irony attends the publication of any good new book on American usage. It is that the people who are going to be interested in such a book are also the people who are least going to need it, i.e., that offering counsel on the finer points of U.S. English is Preaching to the Choir. The relevant Choir here comprises that small percentage of American citizens who actually care about the current status of double modals and ergative verbs. The same sorts of people who watched Story of English on PBS (twice) and read W. Safire's column with their half-caff every Sunday. The sorts of people who feel that special blend of wincing despair and sneering superiority when they see EXPRESS LANE — 10 ITEMS OR LESS or hear dialogue used as a verb or realize that the founders of the Super 8 motel chain must surely have been ignorant of the meaning of suppurate. There are lots of epithets for people like this — Grammar Nazis, Usage Nerds, Syntax Snobs, the Language Police. The term I was raised with is SNOOT. The word might be slightly self-mocking, but those other terms are outright dysphemisms. A SNOOT can be defined as somebody who knows what dysphemism means and doesn't mind letting you know it.
I submit that we SNOOTs are just about the last remaining kind of truly elitist nerd. There are, granted, plenty of nerd-species in today's America, and some of these are elitist within their own nerdy purview (e.g., the skinny, carbuncular, semi-autistic Computer Nerd moves instantly up on the totem pole of status when your screen freezes and now you need his help, and the bland condescension with which he performs the two occult keystrokes that unfreeze your screen is both elitist and situationally valid). But the SNOOT's purview is interhuman social life itself. You don't, after all (despite withering cultural pressure), have to use a computer, but you can't escape language: Language is everything and everywhere; it's what lets us have anything to do with one another; it's what separates us from the animals; Genesis 11:7-10 and so on. And we SNOOTS know when and how to hyphenate phrasal adjectives and to keep participles from dangling, and we know that we know, and we know how very few other Americans know this stuff or even care, and we judge them accordingly.
In ways that certain of us are uncomfortable about, SNOOTs' attitudes about contemporary usage resemble religious/political conservatives' attitudes about contemporary culture: We combine a missionary zeal and a near-neural faith in our beliefs' importance with a curmudgeonly hell-in-a-handbasket despair at the way English is routinely manhandled and corrupted by supposedly educated people. The Evil is all around us: boners and clunkers and solecistic howlers and bursts of voguish linguistic methane that make any SNOOT's cheek twitch and forehead darken. A fellow SNOOT I know likes to say that listening to most people's English feels like watching somebody use a Stradivarius to pound nails. We are the Few, the Proud, the Appalled at Everyone Else.
THESIS STATEMENT FOR WHOLE ARTICLE
Issues of tradition vs. egalitarianism in U.S. English are at root political issues and can be effectively addressed only in what this article hereby terms a ""Democratic Spirit."" A Democratic Spirit is one that combines rigor and humility, i.e., passionate conviction plus sedulous respect for the convictions of others. As any American knows, this is a very difficult spirit to cultivate and maintain, particularly when it comes to issues you feel strongly about. Equally tough is a D.S.'s criterion of 100 percent intellectual integrity — you have to be willing to look honestly at yourself and your motives for believing what you believe, and to do it more or less continually.
This kind of stuff is advanced U.S. citizenship. A true Democratic Spirit is up there with religious faith and emotional maturity and all those other top-of-the-Maslow-Pyramid-type qualities people spend their whole lives working on. A Democratic Spirit's constituent rigor and humility and honesty are in fact so hard to maintain on certain issues that it's almost irresistibly tempting to fall in with some established dogmatic camp and to follow that camp's line on the issue and to let your position harden within the camp and become inflexible and to believe that any other camp is either evil or insane and to spend all your time and energy trying to shout over them.
I submit, then, that it is indisputably easier to be dogmatic than Democratic, especially about issues that are both vexed and highly charged. I submit further that the issues surrounding ""correctness"" in contemporary American usage are both vexed and highly charged, and that the fundamental questions they involve are ones whose answers have to be ""worked out"" instead of simply found.
A distinctive feature of ADMAU is that its author is willing to acknowledge that a usage dictionary is not a bible or even a textbook but rather just the record of one smart person's attempts to work out answers to certain very difficult questions. This willingness appears to me to be informed by a Democratic Spirit. The big question is whether such a spirit compromises Garner's ability to present himself as a genuine ""authority"" on issues of usage. Assessing Garner's book, then, involves trying to trace out the very weird and complicated relationship between Authority and Democracy in what we as a culture have decided is English. That relationship is, as many educated Americans would say, still in process at this time.
A Dictionary of Modern American Usage has no Editorial Staff or Distinguished Panel. It's conceived, researched, and written ab ovo usque ad mala by Bryan Garner. This is an interesting guy. He's both a lawyer and a lexicographer (which seems a bit like being both a narcotics dealer and a DEA agent). His 1987 A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage is already a minor classic; now, instead of practicing law anymore, he goes around conducting writing seminars for J.D.'s and doing prose-consulting for various judicial bodies. Garner's also the founder of something called the H. W. Fowler Society, a worldwide group of usage-Trekkies who like to send one another linguistic boners clipped from different periodicals. You get the idea. This Garner is one serious and very hard-core SNOOT.
The lucid, engaging, and extremely sneaky Preface to ADMAU serves to confirm Garner's SNOOTitude in fact while undercutting it in tone. For one thing, whereas the traditional usage pundit cultivates a sort of remote and imperial persona — the kind who uses one or we to refer to himself — Garner gives us an almost Waltonishly endearing sketch of his own background:
I realized early at the age of 15 — that my primary
intellectual interest was the use of the English language....
It became an all-consuming passion.... I read everything
I could find on the subject. Then, on a wintry evening
while visiting New Mexico at the age of 16, I discovered
Eric Partridge's Usage and Abusage. I was enthralled.
Never had I held a more exciting book.... Suffice it
to say that by the time I was 18, I had committed to
memory most of Fowler, Partridge, and their successors....
Although this reviewer regrets the biosketch's failure to mention the rather significant social costs of being an adolescent whose overriding passion is English usage, the critical hat is off to yet another personable section of the Preface, one that Garner entitles ""First Principles"": ""Before going any further, I should explain my approach. That's an unusual thing for the author of a usage dictionary to do — unprecedented, as far as I know. But a guide to good writing is only as good as the principles on which it's based. And users should be naturally interested in those principles. So, in the interests of full disclosure ...""
The ""unprecedented"" and ""full disclosure"" here are actually good-natured digs at Garner's Fowlerite predecessors, and a subtle nod to one camp in the wars that have raged in both lexicography and education ever since the notoriously liberal Webster's Third New International Dictionary came out in 1961 and included such terms as heighth and irregardless without any monitory labels on them. You can think of Webster's Third as sort of the Fort Sumter of the contemporary Usage Wars. These Wars are both the context and the target of a very subtle rhetorical strategy in A Dictionary of Modern American Usage, and without talking about them it's impossible to explain why Garner's book is both so good and so sneaky.
We regular citizens tend to go to The Dictionary for authoritative guidance. Rarely, however, do we ask ourselves who decides what gets in The Dictionary or what words or spellings or pronunciations get deemed ""substandard"" or ""incorrect."" Whence the authority of dictionary-makers to decide what's OK and what isn't? Nobody elected them, after all. And simply appealing to precedent or tradition won't work, because what's considered correct changes over time. In the 1600s, for instance, the second-singular pronoun took a singular conjugation — ""You is."" Earlier still, the standard 2-S pronoun wasn't ""you"" but ""thou"". Huge numbers of now acceptable words like clever, fun, banter, and prestigious entered English as what usage authorities considered errors or egregious slang. And not just usage conventions but English itself changes over time; if it didn't, we'd all still be talking like Chaucer. Who's to say which changes are natural and which are corruptions? And when Bryan Garner or E. Ward Gilman do in fact presume to say, why should we believe them?
These sorts of questions are not new, but they do now have a certain urgency. America is in the midst of a protracted Crisis of Authority in matters of language. In brief, the same sorts of political upheavals that produced everything from Kent State to Independent Counsels have produced an influential contra-SNOOT school for whom normative standards of English grammar and usage are functions of nothing but custom and superstition and the ovine docility of a populace that lets self-appointed language authorities boss them around. See for example MIT's Steven Pinker in a famous New Republic article — ""Once introduced, a prescriptive rule is very hard to eradicate, no matter how ridiculous. Inside the writing establishment, the rules survive by the same dynamic that perpetuates ritual genital mutilations"" — or, at a somewhat lower pitch, Bill Bryson in Mother Tongue: English and How It Got That Way:
Who sets down all those rules that we all know
about from childhood: the idea that we must never
end a sentence with a preposition or begin one with
a conjunction, that we must use ""each other"" for two
things and ""one another"" for more than two ...? The
answer, surprisingly often, is that no one does,
that when you look into the background of these
""rules"" there is often little basis for them.
In ADMAU's Preface, Garner himself addresses the Authority Question with a Trumanesque simplicity and candor that simultaneously disguise the author's cunning and exemplify it:
As you might already suspect, I don't shy away
from making judgments. I can't imagine that most
readers would want me to. Linguists don't like it,
of course, because judgment involves subjectivity.
It isn't scientific. But rhetoric and usage, in the view
of most professional writers, aren't scientific endeavors.
You don't want dispassionate descriptions; you want
sound guidance. And that requires judgment.
Whole monographs could be written just on the masterful rhetoric of this passage. Note for example the ingenious equivocation of judgment in ""I don't shy away from making judgments"" vs. ""And that requires judgment."" Suffice it to say that Garner is at all times keenly aware of the Authority Crisis in modern usage; and his response to this crisis is in the best Democratic Spirit rhetorical.
So ...
COROLLARY TO THESIS STATEMENT FOR WHOLE ARTICLE
The most salient and timely feature of Garner's book is that it's both lexicographical and rhetorical. Its main strategy involves what is known in classical rhetoric as the Ethical Appeal. Here the adjective, derived from the Greek ethos, doesn't mean quite what we usually mean by ethical. But there are affinities. What the Ethical Appeal amounts to is a complex and sophisticated ""Trust me."" It's the boldest, most ambitious, and also most distinctively American of rhetorical Appeals, because it requires the rhetor to convince us not just of his intellectual acuity or technical competence but of his basic decency and fairness and sensitivity to the audience's own hopes and fears.
These are not qualities one associates with the traditional SNOOT usage-authority, a figure who pretty much instantiates snobbishness and bow-tied anality, and one whose modern image is not improved by stuff like American Heritage Dictionary Distinguished Usage Panelist Morris Bishop's ""The arrant solecisms of the ignoramus are here often omitted entirely, `irregardless' of how he may feel about this neglect"" or critic John Simon's ""The English language is being treated nowadays exactly as slave traders once handled their merchandise...."" Compare those lines' authorial personas with Garner's in, e.g., ""English usage is so challenging that even experienced writers need guidance now and then.""
The thrust here is going to be that A Dictionary of Modern American Usage earns Garner pretty much all the trust his Ethical Appeal asks us for. The book's ""feel-good"" spirit (in the very best sense of ""feel-good"") marries rigor and humility in such a way as to allow Garner to be extremely prescriptive without any appearance of evangelism or elitist putdown. This is an extraordinary accomplishment. Understanding why it's basically a rhetorical accomplishment, and why this is both historically significant and (in this reviewer's opinion) politically redemptive, requires a more detailed look at the Usage Wars.
You'd sure know lexicography had an underbelly if you read the little introductory essays in modern dictionaries — pieces like Webster's DEU's ""A Brief History of English Usage"" or Webster's Third's ""Linguistic Advances and Lexicography"" or AHD-3's ""Usage in the American Heritage Dictionary: The Place of Criticism."" But almost nobody ever bothers with these little intros, and it's not just their six-point type or the fact that dictionaries tend to be hard on the lap. It's that these intros aren't actually written for you or me or the average citizen who goes to The Dictionary just to see how to spell (for instance) meringue. They're written for other lexicographers and critics, and in fact they're not really introductory at all but polemical. They're salvos in the Usage Wars that have been under way ever since editor Philip Gove first sought to apply the value-neutral principles of structural linguistics to lexicography in Webster's Third. Gove's famous response to conservatives who howled when Webster's Third endorsed OK and described ain't as ""used orally in most parts of the U.S. by many cultivated speakers "" was this: ""A dictionary should have no traffic with ... artificial notions of correctness or superiority. It should be descriptive and not prescriptive."" These terms stuck and turned epithetic, and linguistic conservatives are now formally known as Prescriptivists and linguistic liberals as Descriptivists.
The former are far better known. When you read the columns of William Safire or Morton Freeman or books like Edwin Newman's Strictly Speaking or John Simon's Paradigms Lost, you're actually reading Popular Prescriptivism, a genre sideline of certain journalists (mostly older ones, the vast majority of whom actually do wear bow ties) whose bemused irony often masks a Colonel Blimp's rage at the way the beloved English of their youth is being trashed in the decadent present. The plutocratic tone and styptic wit of Safire and Newman and the best of the Prescriptivists is often modeled after the mandarin-Brit personas of Eric Partridge and H. W. Fowler, the same Twin Towers of scholarly Prescriptivism whom Garner talks about revering as a kid.
Descriptivists, on the other hand, don't have weekly columns in the Times. These guys tend to be hard-core academics, mostly linguists or Comp theorists. Loosely organized under the banner of structural (or ""descriptive"") linguistics, they are doctrinaire positivists who have their intellectual roots in the work of Auguste Comte and Ferdinand de Saussure and their ideological roots firmly in the U.S. sixties. The brief explicit mention Garner's Preface gives this crew —
Somewhere along the line, though, usage dictionaries
got hijacked by the descriptive linguists. who observe
language scientifically. For the pure descriptivist, it's
impermissible to say that one form of language is
any better than another: as long as a native speaker
says it, it's OK — and anyone who takes a contrary
stand is a dunderhead.... Essentially, descriptivists and
prescriptivists are approaching different problems.
Descriptivists want to record language as it's actually
used, and they perform a useful function — though
their audience is generally limited to those willing to pore
through vast tomes of dry-as-dust research.
— is disingenuous in the extreme, especially the ""approaching different problems"" part, because it vastly underplays the Descriptivists' influence on U.S. culture. For one thing, Descriptivism so quickly and thoroughly took over English education in this country that just about everybody who started junior high after c. 1970 has been taught to write Descriptively — via ""freewriting,"" ""brainstorming,"" ""journaling,"" a view of writing as self-exploratory and -expressive rather than as communicative, an abandonment of systematic grammar, usage, semantics, rhetoric, etymology. For another thing, the very language in which today's socialist, feminist, minority, gay, and environmentalist movements frame their sides of political debates is informed by the Descriptivist belief that traditional English is conceived and perpetuated by Privileged WASP Males and is thus inherently capitalist, sexist, racist, xenophobic, homophobic, elitist: unfair. Think Ebonics. Think of the involved contortions people undergo to avoid he as a generic pronoun, or of the tense deliberate way white males now adjust their vocabularies around non-w.m.'s. Think of today's endless battles over just the names of things — ""Affirmative Action"" vs. ""Reverse Discrimination,"" ""Pro-Life"" vs. ""Pro-Choice,"" ""Undercount"" vs. ""Vote Fraud,"" etc.
The Descriptivist revolution takes a little time to unpack, but it's worth it. The structural linguists' rejection of conventional usage rules depends on two main arguments. The first is academic and methodological. In this age of technology, Descriptivists contend, it's the Scientific Method — clinically objective, value-neutral, based on direct observation and demonstrable hypothesis — that should determine both the content of dictionaries and the standards of ""correct"" English. Because language is constantly evolving, such standards will always be fluid. Gore's now classic introduction to Webster's Third outlines this type of Descriptivism's five basic edicts:
""1 — Language changes constantly;
2 — Change is normal;
3 — Spoken language is the language;
4 — Correctness rests upon usage;
5 — All usage is relative.""
These principles look prima facie OK — commonsensical and couched in the bland simple s.-v.-o, prose of dispassionate Science — but in fact they're vague and muddled and it takes about three seconds to think of reasonable replies to each one of them, viz.:
1 — OK, but how much and how fast?
2 — Same thing. Is Heraclitean flux as normal or desirable as gradual change ? Do some changes actually serve the language's overall pizzazz better than others? And how many people have to deviate from how many conventions before we say the language has actually changed? Fifty percent? Ten percent?
3 — This is an old claim, at least as old as Plato's Phaedrus. And it's specious. If Derrida and the infamous Deconstructionists have done nothing else, they've debunked the idea that speech is language's primary instantiation. Plus consider the weird arrogance of Gove's (3) w/r/t correctness. Only the most mullahlike Prescriptivists care very much about spoken English; most Prescriptive usage guides concern Standard Written English.
4 — Fine, but whose usage? Gove's (4) begs the whole question. What he wants to imply here, I think, is a reversal of the traditional entailment-relation between abstract rules and concrete usage: Instead of usage ideally corresponding to a rigid set of regulations, the regulations ought to correspond to the way real people are actually using the language. Again, fine, but which people? Urban Latinos? Boston Brahmins? Rural Midwesterners? Appalachian Neogaelics?
5 — Huh? If this means what it seems to mean, then it ends up biting Gove's whole argument in the ass. (5) appears to imply that the correct answer to the above ""which people?"" is: ""All of them!"" And it's easy to show why this will not stand up as a lexicographical principle. The most obvious problem with it is that not everything can go in The Dictionary. Why not? Because you can't observe every last bit of every last native speaker's ""language behavior,"" and even if you could, the resultant dictionary would weigh 4 million pounds and have to be updated hourly. The fact is that any lexicographer is going to have to make choices about what gets in and what doesn't. And these choices are based on ... what? And now we're right back where we started.
It is true that, as a SNOOT, I am probably neurologically predisposed to look for flaws in Gove et al.'s methodological argument. But these flaws seem awfully easy to find. Probably the biggest one is that the Descriptivists' ""scientific lexicography"" — under which, keep in mind, the ideal English dictionary is basically number-crunching; you somehow observe every linguistic act by every native/naturalized speaker of English and put the sum of all these acts between two covers and call it The Dictionary — involves an incredibly simplistic and outdated understanding of what ""scientific"" means. It requires a naive belief in scientific objectivity, for one thing. Even in the physical sciences, everything from quantum mechanics to Information Theory has shown that an act of observation is itself part of the phenomenon observed and is analytically inseparable from it.
If you remember your old college English classes, there's an analogy here that points up the trouble scholars get into when they confuse observation with interpretation. Recall the New Critics. They believed that literary criticism was best conceived as a ""scientific"" endeavor: The critic was a neutral, careful, unbiased, highly trained observer whose job was to find and objectively describe meanings that were right there — literally inside — pieces of literature. Whether you know what happened to the New Criticism's reputation depends on whether you took college English after c. 1975; suffice it to say that its star bas dimmed. The New Critics had the same basic problem as Gove's Methodological Descriptivists: They believed that scientific meant the same thing as neutral or unbiased. And that linguistic meanings could exist ""objectively,"" separate from any interpretive act.
The point of the analogy is that claims to objectivity in language study are now the stuff of jokes and shudders. The epistemological assumptions that underlie Methodological Descriptivism have been thoroughly debunked and displaced — n Lit by the rise of post-structuralism, Reader-Response Criticism, and Jaussian Reception Theory; in linguistics by the rise of Pragmatics — and it's now pretty much universally accepted that (a) meaning is inseparable from some act of interpretation and (b) an act of interpretation is always somewhat biased, i.e., informed by the interpreter's particular ideology. And the consequence of (a) and (b) is that there's no way around it — decisions about what to put in The Dictionary and what to exclude are going to be based on a lexicographer's ideology. And every lexicographer's got one. To presume that dictionary-making can somehow avoid or transcend ideology is simply to subscribe to a particular ideology, one that might aptly be called Unbelievably Naive Positivism.
There's an even more important way Descriptivists are wrong in thinking that the Scientific Method is appropriate to the study of language:
Even if, as a thought experiment, we assume a kind of nineteenth-century scientific realism-in which, even though some scientists' interpretations of natural phenomena might be biased the natural phenomena themselves can be supposed to exist wholly independent of either observation or interpretation — no such realist supposition can be made about ""language behavior,"" because this behavior is both human and fundamentally normative. To understand this, you have only to accept the proposition that language is by its very nature public — i.e., that there can be no such thing as a Private Language and then to observe the way Methodological Descriptivists seem either ignorant of this fact or oblivious to its consequences, as in for example one Charles Fries's introduction to an epigone of Webster's Third called The American College Dictionary:
A dictionary can be an ""authority"" only in the
sense in which a book of chemistry or of physics
or of botany can be an ""authority"": by the accuracy
and the completeness of its record of the observed
facts of the field examined, in accord with the latest
principles and techniques of the particular science.
This is so stupid it practically drools. An ""authoritative"" physics text presents the results of physicists' observations and physicists' theories about those observations. If a physics textbook operated on Descriptivist principles, the fact that some Americans believe that electricity flows better downhill (based on the observed fact that power lines tend to run high above the homes they serve) would require the Electricity Flows Better Downhill Theory to be included as a ""valid"" theory in the textbook — just as, for Dr. Fries, if some Americans use infer for imply, the use becomes an ipso facto ""valid"" part of the language. Structural linguists like Gove and Fries are not, finally, scientists but census-takers who happen to misconstrue the importance of ""observed facts."" It isn't scientific phenomena they're tabulating but rather a set of human behaviors, and a lot of human behaviors are — to be blunt — moronic. Try, for instance, to imagine an ""authoritative"" ethics textbook whose principles were based on what most people actually do.
Norm-wise, let's keep in mind that language didn't come into being because our hairy ancestors were sitting around the veldt with nothing better to do. Language was invented to serve certain specific purposes: ""That mushroom is poisonous""; ""Knock these two rocks together and you can start a fire""; ""This shelter is mine!"" And so on. Clearly, as linguistic communities evolve over time, they discover that some ways of using language are ""better"" than others — meaning better with respect to the community's purposes. If we assume that one such purpose might be communicating which kinds of food are safe to eat, then you can see how, for example, a misplaced modifier might violate an important norm:
""People who eat that kind of mushroom often get sick"" confuses the recipient about whether he'll get sick only if he eats the mushroom frequently or whether he stands a good chance of getting sick the very first time he eats it. In other words, the community has a vested practical interest in excluding this kind of misplaced modifier from acceptable usage; and even if a certain percentage of tribesmen screw up and use them, this still doesn't make m.m.'s a good idea.
Maybe now the analogy between usage and ethics is clearer. Just because people sometimes lie, cheat on their taxes, or scream at their kids, this doesn't mean that they think those things are ""good."" The whole point of norms is to help us evaluate our actions (including utterances) according to what we as a community have decided our real interests and purposes are. Granted, this analysis is oversimplified; in practice it's incredibly hard to arrive at norms and to keep them at least minimally fair or sometimes even to agree on what they are (q.v. today's Culture Wars). But the Descriptivists' assumption that all usage norms are arbitrary and dispensable leads to — well, have a mushroom.
The connotations of arbitrary here are tricky, though, and this sort of segues into the second argument Descriptivists make. There is a sense in which specific linguistic conventions are arbitrary. For instance, there's no particular metaphysical reason why our word for a four-legged mammal that gives milk and goes Moo is cow and not, say, prtlmpf. The uptown phrase for this is ""the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign,"" and it's used, along with certain principles of cognitive science and generative grammar, in a more philosophically sophisticated version of Descriptivism that holds the conventions of SWE to be more like the niceties of fashion than like actual norms. This ""Philosophical Descriptivism"" doesn't care much about dictionaries or method; its target is the standard SNOOT claim supra — that prescriptive rules have their ultimate justification in the community's need to make its language meaningful.
The argument goes like this. An English sentence's being meaningful is not the same as its being grammatical. That is, such clearly ill-formed constructions as ""Did you seen the car keys of me?"" or ""The show was looked by many people"" are nevertheless comprehensible; the sentences do, more or less, communicate the information they're trying to get across. Add to this the fact that nobody who isn't damaged in some profound Oliver Sacksish way actually ever makes these sorts of very deep syntactic errors and you get the basic proposition of Noam Chomsky's generative linguistics, which is that there exists a Universal Grammar beneath and common to all languages, plus that there is probably an actual part of the human brain that's imprinted with this Universal Grammar the same way birds' brains are imprinted with Fly South and dogs' with Sniff Genitals. There's all kinds of compelling evidence and support for these ideas, not least of which are the advances that linguists and cognitive scientists and A.I. researchers have been able to make with them, and the theories have a lot of credibility, and they are adduced by the Philosophical Descriptivists to show that since the really important rules of language are at birth already hardwired into people's neocortex; SWE prescriptions against dangling participles or mixed metaphors are basically the linguistic equivalent of whalebone corsets and short forks for salad. As Descriptivist Steven Pinker puts it, ""When a scientist considers all the high-tech mental machinery needed to order words into everyday sentences, prescriptive rules are, at best, inconsequential decorations.""
This argument is not the barrel of drugged trout that Methodological Descriptivism was, but it's still vulnerable to some objections. The first one is easy. Even if it's true that we're all wired with a Universal Grammar, it simply doesn't follow that all prescriptive rules are superfluous. Some of these rules really do seem to serve clarity, and precision. The injunction against twoway adverbs (""People who eat this often get sick"") is an obvious example, as are rules about other kinds of misplaced modifiers (""There are many reasons why lawyers lie, some better than others"") and about relative pronouns' proximity to the nouns they modify (""She's the mother of an infant daughter who works twelve hours a day"").
Granted the Philosophical Descriptivist can question just how absolutely necessary these rules are, it's quite likely that a recipient of clauses like the above could figure out what the sentences mean from the sentences on either side or from the ""overall context"" or whatever. A listener can usually figure out what I really mean when I misuse infer for imply or say indicate for say, too. But many of these solecisms require at least a couple extra nanoseconds of cognitive effort, a kind of rapid sift-and-discard process, before the recipient gets it. Extra work. It's debatable just how much extra work, but it seems indisputable that we put some extra neural burden on the recipient when we fail to follow certain conventions. W/r/t confusing clauses like the above, it simply seems more ""considerate"" to follow the rules of correct SWE ... just as it's more ""considerate"" to de-slob your home before entertaining guests or to brush your teeth before picking up a date. Not just more considerate but more respectful somehow — both of your listener and of what you're trying to get across. As we sometimes also say about elements of fashion and etiquette, the way you use English ""Makes a Statement"" or ""Sends a Message"" — even though these Statements/Messages often have nothing to do with the actual information you're trying to transmit.
We've now sort of bled into a more serious rejoinder to Philosophical Descriptivism: From the fact that linguistic communication is not strictly dependent on usage and grammar it does not necessarily follow that the traditional rules of usage and grammar are nothing but ""inconsequential decorations."" Another way to state the objection is that just because something is ""decorative"" does not necessarily make it ""inconsequential."" Rhetorically, Pinker's flip dismissal is bad tactics, for it invites the very question it begs: inconsequential to whom?
Take, for example, the Descriptivism claim that so-called correct English usages such as brought rather than brung and felt rather than feeled are arbitrary and restrictive and unfair and are supported only by custom and are (like irregular verbs in general) archaic and incommodious and an all-around pain in the ass. Let us concede for the moment that these objections are 100 percent reasonable. Then let's talk about pants. Trousers, slacks. I suggest to you that having the ""correct"" subthoracic clothing for U.S. males be pants instead of skirts is arbitrary (lots of other cultures let men wear skirts), restrictive and unfair (U.S. females get to wear pants), based solely on archaic custom (I think it's got something to do with certain traditions about gender and leg position, the same reasons girls' bikes don't have a crossbar), and in certain ways not only incommodious but illogical (skirts are more comfortable than pants; pants ride up; pants are hot; pants can squish the genitals and reduce fertility; over time pants chafe and erode irregular sections of men's leg hair and give older men hideous half-denuded legs, etc. etc.). Let us grant — as a thought experiment if nothing else — that these are all reasonable and compelling objections to pants as an androsartorial norm. Let us in fact in our minds and hearts say yes — shout yes — to the skirt, the kilt, the toga, the sarong, the jupe. Let us dream of or even in our spare time work toward an America where nobody lays any arbitrary sumptuary prescriptions on anyone else and we can all go around as comfortable and aerated and unchafed and unsquished and motile as we want.
And yet the fact remains that, in the broad cultural mainstream of millennial America, men do not wear skirts. If you, the reader, are a U.S. male, and even if you share my personal objections to pants and dream as I do of a cool and genitally unsquishy American Tomorrow, the odds are still 99.9 percent that in 100 percent of public situations you wear pants/slacks/shorts/trunks. More to the point, if you are a U.S. male and also have a U.S. male child, and if that child were to come to you one evening and announce his desire/intention to wear a skirt rather than pants to school the next day, I am 100-percent confident that you are going to discourage him from doing so. Strongly discourage him. You could be a Molotov-tossing anti-pants radical or a kilt manufacturer or Steven Pinker himself — you're going to stand over your kid and be prescriptive about an arbitrary, archaic, uncomfortable, and inconsequentially decorative piece of clothing. Why? Well, because in modern America any little boy who comes to school in a skirt (even, say, a modest all-season midi) is going to get stared at and shunned and beaten up and called a Total Geekoid by a whole lot of people whose approval and acceptance are important to him. In our culture, in other words, a boy who wears a skirt is Making a Statement that is going to have all kinds of gruesome social and emotional consequences.
You see where this is going. I'm going to describe the intended point of the pants analogy in terms I'm sure are simplistic — doubtless there are whole books in Pragmatics or psycholinguistics or something devoted to unpacking this point. The weird thing is that I've seen neither Descriptivists nor SNOTs deploy it in the Wars.
When I say or write something, there are actually a whole lot of different things I am communicating. The propositional content (the actual information I'm trying to convey) is only one part of it. Another part is stuff about me, the communicator. Everyone knows this. It's a function of the fact that there are uncountably many well-formed ways to say the same basic thing, from e.g. ""I was attacked by a bear!"" to ""Goddamn bear tried to kill me!"" to ""That ursine juggernaut bethought to sup upon my person!"" and so on. And different levels of diction and formality are only the simplest kinds of distinction; things get way more complicated in the sorts of interpersonal communication where social relations and feelings and moods come into play. Here's a familiar sort of example. Suppose that you and I are acquaintances and we're in my apartment having a conversation and that at some point I want to terminate the conversation and not have you be in my apartment anymore. Very delicate social moment. Think of all the different ways I can try to handle it: ""Wow, look at the time""; ""Could we finish this up later?""; ""Could you please leave now?""; ""Go""; ""Get out""; ""Get the hell out of here""; ""Didn't you say you had to be someplace?""; ""Time for you to hit the dusty trail, my friend""; ""Off you go then, love""; or that sly old telephone-conversation ender: ""Well, I'm going to let you go now""; etc. And then think of all the different factors and implications of each option.
The point here is obvious. It concerns a phenomenon that SNOOTS blindly reinforce and that Descriptivists badly underestimate and that scary vocab-tape ads try to exploit. People really do ""judge"" one another according to their use of language. Constantly. Of course, people judge one another on the basis of all kinds of things — weight, scent, physiognomy, occupation, make of vehicle — and, again, doubtless it's all terribly complicated and occupies whole battalions of sociolinguists. But it's clear that at least one component of all this interpersonal semantic judging involves acceptance, meaning not some touchy-feely emotional affirmation but actual acceptance or rejection of somebody's bid to be regarded as a peer, a member of somebody else's collective or community or Group. Another way to come at this is to acknowledge something that in the Usage Wars gets mentioned only in very abstract terms: ""Correct"" English usage is, as a practical matter, a function of whom you're talking to and how you want that person to respond — not just to your utterance but also to you. In other words, a large part of the agenda of any communication is rhetorical and depends on what some rhet-scholars call ""Audience"" or ""Discourse Community."" And the United States obviously has a huge number of such Discourse Communities, many of them regional and/or cultural dialects of English: Black English, Latino English, Rural Southern, Urban Southern, Standard Upper-Midwest, Maine Yankee, East-Texas Bayou, Boston BlueCollar, on and on. Everybody knows this. What not everyone knows — especially not certain Prescriptivists — is that many of these non-SWE dialects have their own highly developed and internally consistent grammars, and that some of these dialects' usage norms actually make more linguistic/aesthetic sense than do their Standard counterparts (see INTERPOLATION). Plus, of course, there are innumerable sub- and subsubdialects based on all sorts of things that have nothing to do with locale or ethnicity — Medical-School English, Peorians-Who-Follow-Pro-Wrestling-Closely English, Twelve-Year-Old-Males-Whose-Worldview-Is-Deeply-Informed-By-South-Park English — and that are nearly incomprehensible to anyone who isn't inside their very tight and specific Discourse Community (which of course is part of their function).
INTERPOLATION: EXAMPLE OF GRAMMATICAL ADVANTAGES OF A NON-STANDARD DIALECT THAT THIS REVIEWER ACTUALLY KNOWS ABOUT FIRSTHAND
This rev. happens to have two native English dialects — the SWE of my hypereducated parents and the hard-earned Rural Midwestern of most of my peers. When I'm talking to R.M.'s, I usually use, for example, the construction ""Where's it at?"" instead of ""Where is it?"" Part of this is a naked desire to fit in and not get rejected as an egghead or fag (see sub). But another part is that I, SNOOT or no, believe that this and other R.M.isms are in certain ways superior to their Standard equivalents.
For a dogmatic Prescriptivist, ""Where's it at?"" is double-damned as a sentence that not only ends with a preposition but whose final preposition forms a redundancy with where that's similar to the redundancy in ""the reason is because"" (which latter usage I'll admit makes me dig my nails into my palms). Rejoinder: First off, the avoid-terminal-prepositions rule is the invention of one Fr. R. Lowth, an eighteenth-century British preacher and indurate pedant who did things like spend scores of pages arguing for hath over the trendy and degenerate has. The a.-t.-p. rule is antiquated and stupid and only the most ayatolloid SNOOT takes it seriously. Garner himself calls the rule ""stuffy"" and lists all kinds of useful constructions like ""the man you were listening to"" that we'd have to discard or distort if we really enforced it.
Plus the apparent redundancy of ""Where's it at?""  is offset by its metrical logic. What the at really does is license the contraction of is after the interrogative adverb. You can't say ""Where's it?"" So the choice is between ""Where is it?"" and ""Where's it at?"", and the latter, a strong anapest, is prettier and trips off the tongue better than ""Where is it?"", whose meter is either a clunky monosyllabic foot + trochee or it's nothing at all.
This is probably the place for your SNOOT reviewer openly to concede that a certain number of traditional prescriptive rules really are stupid and that people who insist on them (like the legendary assistant to PM. Margaret Thatcher who refused to read any memo with a split infinitive in it, or the jr.-high teacher I had who automatically graded you down if you started a sentence with Hopefully) are that very most pathetic and dangerous sort of SNOOT, the SNOOT Who Is Wrong. The injunction against split infinitives, for instance, is a consequence of the weird fact that English grammar is modeled on Latin even though Latin is a synthetic language and English is an analytic language.  Latin infinitives consist of one word and are impossible to as it were split, and the earliest English Prescriptivists — so enthralled with Latin that their English usage guides were actually written in Latin  — decided that English infinitives shouldn't be split either. Garner himself takes out after the s.i. rule in both SPLIT INFINITIVES and SUPERSTITIONS.  And Hopefully at the beginning of a sentence, as a certain cheeky eighth-grader once pointed out to his everlasting social cost, actually functions not as a misplaced modal auxiliary or as a manner adverb like quickly or angrily but as a ""sentence adverb"" that indicates the speaker's attitude about the state of affairs described by the sentence (examples of perfectly OK sentence adverbs are Clearly, Basically, Luckily), and only SNOOTs educated in the high-pedantic years up to 1960 blindly proscribe it or grade it down.
The cases of split infinitives and Hopefully are in fact often trotted out by dogmatic Descriptivists as evidence that all SWE usage rules are arbitrary and stupid (which is a bit like pointing to Pat Buchanan as evidence that all Republicans are maniacs). Garner rejects Hopefully's knee-jerk proscription, too, albeit grudgingly, including the adverb in his miniessay on SKUNKED TERMS, which is his phrase for a usage that is ""hotly disputed.., any use of it is likely to distract some readers."" (Garner also points out something I'd never quite realized, which is that hopefully, if misplaced/mispunctuated in the body of a sentence, can create some of the same two-way ambiguities as other adverbs, as in the clause ""I will borrow your book and hopefully read it soon."")
Whether we're conscious of it or or, most of us are fluent in more than one major English dialect and in a large number of subdialects and are probably at least passable in countless others. Which dialect you choose to use depends, of course, on whom you're addressing. More to the point, I submit that the dialect you use depends mostly on what sort of Group your listener is part of and whether you wish to present yourself as a fellow member of that Group. An obvious example is that traditional upper-class English has certain dialectal differences from lower-class English and that schools used to have courses in Elocution whose whole point was to teach people how to speak in an upper-class way. But usage-as-inclusion is about much more than class. Here's another thought experiment: A bunch of U.S. teenagers in clothes that look far too large for them are sitting together in the local mall's Food Court, and a 53-year-old man with a combover and clothes that fit comes over to them and says that he was scoping them and thinks they're totally rad and/or phat and is it cool if he just kicks it and does the hang here with them. The kids' reaction is going to be either scorn or embarrassment for the guy — most likely a mix of both. Q: Why? Or imagine that two hard-core urban black guys are standing there talking and I, who am resoundingly and in all ways white, come up and greet them with ""Yo"" and call them ""Brothers"" and ask ""s'up, s'goin on,"" pronouncing on with that NYCish oo-o diphthong that Young Urban Black English deploys for a standard o. Either these guys are going to be offended or they are going to think I am simply out of my mind. No other reaction is remotely foreseeable. Q: Why?
Why: A dialect of English is learned and used either because it's your native vernacular or because it's the dialect of a Group by which you wish (with some degree of plausibility) to be accepted. And although it is the major and arguably the most important one, SWE is only one dialect. And it is never, or at least hardly ever, anybody's only dialect. This is because there are — as you and I both know and yet no one in the Usage Wars ever seems to mention — situations in which faultlessly correct SWE is clearly not the appropriate dialect.
Childhood is full of such situations. This is one reason why SNOOTlets tend to have a very hard social time of it in school. A SNOOTlet is a little kid who's wildly, precociously fluent in SWE (he is often, recall, the offspring of SNOOTs). Just about every class has a SNOOTlet, so I know you've seen them — these are the sorts of six- to twelve-year-olds who use whom correctly and whose response to striking out in T-ball is to cry out ""How incalculably dreadful!"" etc. The elementary-school SNOOTlet is one of the earliest identifiable species of academic Geekoid and is duly despised by his peers and praised by his teachers. These teachers usually don't see the incredible amounts of punishment the SNOOTlet is receiving from his classmates, or if they do see it they blame the classmates and shake their heads sadly at the vicious and arbitrary cruelty of which children are capable.
But the other children's punishment of the SNOOTIet is not arbitrary at all. There are important things at stake. Little kids in school are learning about Group-inclusion and -exclusion and about the respective rewards and penalties of same and about the use of dialect and syntax and slang as signals of affinity and inclusion.  They're learning about Discourse Communities. Kids learn this stuff not in English or Social Studies but on the playground and at lunch and on the bus. When his peers are giving the SNOOTlet monstrous quadruple Wedgies or holding him down and taking turns spitting on him, there's serious learning going on ... for everyone except the little SNOOT, who in fact is being punished for precisely his failure to learn. What neither he nor his teacher realizes is that the SNOOTlet is deficient in Language Arts. He has only one dialect. He cannot alter his vocabulary, usage, or grammar, cannot use slang or vulgarity; and it's these abilities that are really required for ""peer rapport,"" which is just a fancy Elementary-Ed term for being accepted by the most important Group in the little kid's life.
This reviewer acknowledges that there seems to be some, umm, personal stuff getting dredged up and worked out here; but the stuff is relevant. The point is that the little A+ SNOOTlet is actually in the same dialectal position as the class's ""slow"" kid who can't learn to stop using ain't or bringed. One is punished in class, the other on the playground, but both are deficient in the same linguistic skill — viz., the ability to move between various dialects and levels of ""correctness,"" the ability to communicate one way with peers and another way with teachers and another with family and another with Little League coaches and so on. Most of these dialectal adjustments are made below the level of conscious awareness, and our ability to make them seems part psychological and part something else — perhaps something hardwired into the same motherboard as Universal Grammar — and in truth this ability is a far better indicator of a kid's ""Verbal I.Q."" than test scores or grades, since U.S. English classes do far more to retard dialectal talent than to cultivate it.
Well-known fact: In neither K-12 or college English are systematic WE grammar and usage much taught anymore. It's been this way for more than 20 years. The phenomenon drives Prescriptivists nuts, and it's one of the big things they cite as evidence of America's gradual murder of English. Descriptivists and English-Ed specialists counter that grammar and usage have been abandoned because scientific research proved that studying SWE grammar and usage simply doesn't help make kids better writers. Each side in the debate tends to regard the other as mentally ill or/and blinded by political ideology. Neither camp appears ever to have considered whether maybe the way prescriptive SWE was traditionally taught had something to do with its inutility.
By way here I'm referring not so much to actual method as to spirit or attitude. Most traditional teachers of English grammar have, of course, been dogmatic SNOOTs, and like most dogmatists they've been incredibly stupid about the rhetoric they used and the Audience they were addressing.  I refer specifically to their assumption that SWE is the sole appropriate English dialect and that the only reasons anyone could fail to see this are ignorance or amentia or grave deficiencies in character. As rhetoric, this sort of attitude works only in sermons to the Choir, and as pedagogy it's just disastrous. The reality is that an average U.S. student is going to go to the trouble of mastering the difficult conventions of SWE only if he sees SWE's relevant Group or Discourse Community as one he'd like to be part of. And in the absence of any sort of argument for why the correct-SWE Group is a good or desirable one (an argument that, recall, the traditional teacher hasn't given, because he's such a dogmatic SNOOT he sees no need to), the student is going to be reduced to evaluating the desirability of the SWE Group based on the one obvious member of the Group he's encountered, namely the SNOOTy teacher himself.
I'm not suggesting here that an effective SWE pedagogy would require teachers to wear sunglasses and call students ""Dude."" What I am suggesting is that the rhetorical situation of an English class — a class composed wholly of young people whose Group identity is rooted in defiance of Adult-Establishment values, plus also composed partly of minorities whose primary dialects are different from SWE — requires the teacher to come up with overt, honest, compelling arguments for why SWE is a dialect worth learning.
These arguments are hard to make — not intellectually but emotionally, politically. Because they are baldly elitist.  The real truth, of course, is that SWE is the dialect of the American elite. That it was invented, codified, and promulgated by Privileged WASP Males and is perpetuated as ""Standard"" by same. That it is the shibboleth of the Establishment and an instrument of political power and class division and racial discrimination and all manner of social inequity. These are shall we say rather delicate subjects to bring up in an English class, especially in the service of a pro-SWE argument, and extra-especially if you yourself are both a Privileged WASP Male and the Teacher and thus pretty much a walking symbol of the Adult Establishment. This reviewer's opinion, though, is that both students and SWE are better served if the teacher makes his premises explicit, licit and his argument overt, presenting himself as an advocate of SWE's utility rather than as a prophet of its innate superiority.
Because this argument is both most delicate and (I believe) most important with respect to students of color, here is one version of a spiel I've given in private conference  with certain black students who were (a) bright and inquisitive and (b) deficient in what U.S. higher education considers written English facility:
I don't know whether anybody's told you this or not,
but when you're in a college English class you're basically
studying a foreign dialect. This dialect is called 'Standard
Written English. ... From talking with you and reading
your essays, I've concluded that your own primary dialect
is . Now,
let me spell something out in my official Teacher-voice:
The SBE you're fluent in is different from SWE in all kinds
of important ways. Some of these differences are
grammatical — for example, double negatives are OK
in Standard Black English but not in SWE, and SBE
and SWE conjugate certain verbs in totally different
ways. Other differences have more to do with style —
for instance, Standard Written English tends to use a lot
more subordinate clauses in the early parts of sentences,
and it sets off most of these early subordinates with commas,
and, under SWE rules, writing that doesn't do this is ""choppy.""
There are tons of differences like that. How much of this
stuff do you already know?
[STANDARD RESPONSE: some variation on ""I know from
the grades and comments on my papers that English profs
don't think I'm a good writer.""]
Well, I've got good news and bad news. There are some
otherwise smart English profs who aren't very aware that
there are real dialects of English other than SWE, so when
they're reading your papers they'll put, like, ""Incorrect
conjugation"" or ""Comma needed"" instead of ""SWE
conjugates this verb differently"" or ""SWE calls for a comma
here."" That's the good news — it's not that you're a
bad writer, it's that you haven't learned the special
rules of the dialect they want you to write in. Maybe
that's not such good news, that they were grading you
down for mistakes in a foreign language you didn't even
know was a foreign language. That they won't let you write
in SBE. Maybe it seems unfair. If it does, you're not going
to like this news: I'm not going to let you write in SBE
either. In my class, you have to learn and write in SWE.
If you want to study your own dialect and its rules and history
and how it's different from SWE, fine — there are some
great books by scholars of Black English, and I'll help you
find some and talk about them with you if you want. But
that will be outside class. In class — in my English class —
you will have to master and write in Standard Written English,
which we might just as well call ""Standard White English,""
because it was developed by white people and is used
by white people, especially educated, powerful white people.
I'm respecting you enough here to give you what I believe is
the straight truth. In this country, SWE is perceived as the
dialect of education and intelligence and power and prestige,
and anybody of any race, ethnicity, religion, or gender
who wants to succeed in American culture has got to be able
to use SWE. This is How It Is. You can be glad about it or sad
about it or deeply pissed off. You can believe it's racist and
unjust and decide right here and now to spend every waking
minute of your adult life arguing against it, and maybe you
should, but I'll tell you something: If you ever want those
arguments to get listened to and taken seriously, you're
going to have to communicate them in SWE, because SWE is
the dialect our country uses to talk to itself. African
Americans who've become successful and important in
U.S. culture know this; that's why King's and X's and
Jackson's speeches are in SWE, and why Morrison's and
Angelou's and Baldwin's and Wideman's and West's books
are full of totally ass-kicking SWE, and why black judges
and politicians and journalists and doctors and teachers
communicate professionally in SWE. Some of these people
grew up in homes and communities where SWE was the
native dialect, and these black people had it much easier
in school, but the ones who didn't grow up with SWE
realized at some point that they had to learn it and
become able to write in it, and so they did. And [INSERT
NAME HERE], you're going to learn to use it, too, because
I am going to make you.
I should note here that a couple of the students I've said this stuff to were offended — one lodged an Official Complaint — and that I have had more than one colleague profess to find my spiel ""racially insensitive."" Perhaps you do, too. My own humble opinion is that some of the cultural and political realities of American life are themselves racially insensitive and elitist and offensive and unfair, and that pussyfooting around these realities with euphemistic doublespeak is not only hypocritical but toxic to the project of ever actually changing them. Such pussyfooting has of course now achieved the status of a dialect — one powerful enough to have turned the normal politics of the Usage Wars sort of inside out.
I refer here to Politically Correct English (PCE), under whose conventions failing students become ""high-potential"" students and poor people ""economically disadvantaged"" and people in wheelchairs ""differently abled"" and a sentence like ""White English and Black English are different and you better learn White English if you don't want to flunk"" is not blunt but ""insensitive."" Although it's common to make jokes about PCE (referring to ugly people as ""aesthetically challenged"" and so on), be advised that Politically Correct English's various pre- and proscriptions are taken very seriously indeed by colleges and corporations and government agencies, whose own institutional dialects now evolve under the beady scrutiny of a whole new kind of Language Police.
From one perspective, the history of PCE evinces a kind of Lenin-to-Stalinesque irony. That is, the same ideological principles that informed the original Descriptivist revolution — namely, the sixties-era rejections of traditional authority and traditional inequality — have now actually produced a far more inflexible Prescriptivism, one unencumbered by tradition or complexity and backed by the threat of real-world sanctions (termination, litigation) for those who fail to conform. This is sort of funny in a dark way, maybe, and most criticism of PCE seems to consist in making fun of its trendiness or vapidity. This reviewer's own opinion is that prescriptive PCE is not just silly but confused and dangerous.
Usage is always political, of course, but it's complexly political. With respect, for instance, to political change, usage conventions can function in two ways: On the one hand they can be a reflection of political change, and on the other they can be an instrument of political change. These two functions are different and have to be kept straight. Confusing them — in particular, mistaking for political efficacy what is really just a language's political symbolism ... — enables the bizarre conviction that America ceases to be elitist or unfair simply because Americans stop using certain vocabulary that is historically associated with elitism and unfairness. This is PCE's central fallacy — that a society's mode of expression is productive of its attitudes rather than a product of those attitudes — and of course it's nothing but the obverse of the politically conservative SNOOT'S delusion that social change can be retarded by restricting change in standard usage. 
Forget Stalinization or Logic 101-level equivocations, though. There's a grosser irony about Politically Correct English. This is that PCE purports to be the dialect of progressive reform but is in fact — in its Orwellian substitution of the euphemisms of social equality for social equality itself — of vastly more help to conservatives and the U.S. status quo than traditional SNOOT prescriptions ever were. Were I, for instance, a political conservative who opposed taxation as a means of redistributing national wealth, I would be delighted to watch PCE progressives spend their time and energy arguing over whether a poor person should be described as ""low-income"" or ""economically disadvantaged"" or ""pre-prosperous"" rather than constructing effective public arguments for redistributive legislation or higher marginal tax rates on corporations. (Not to mention that strict codes of egalitarian euphemism serve to burke the sorts of painful, unpretty, and sometimes offensive discourse that in a pluralistic democracy leads to actual political change rather than symbolic political change. In other words, PCE functions as a form of censorship, and censorship always serves the status quo.)
As a practical matter, I strongly doubt whether a guy who has four small kids and makes $12,000 a year feels more empowered or less ill-used by a society that carefully refers to him as ""economically disadvantaged"" rather than ""poor."" Were I he, in fact, I'd probably find the PCE term insulting — not just because it's patronizing but because it's hypocritical and self-serving. Like many forms of Vogue Usage, PCE functions primarily to signal and congratulate certain virtues in the speaker — scrupulous egalitarianism, concern for the dignity of all people, sophistication about the political implications of language — and so serves the selfish interests of the PC far more than it serves any of the persons or groups renamed.
INTERPOLATION ON A RELATED ISSUE IN THE FACE OF WHOSE GHASTLY MALIGNANCY THIS REVIEWER'S DEMOCRATIC SPIRIT JUST GIVES OUT ALTOGETHER, ADMITTEDLY
This issue is Academic English, a cancer that has metastasized now to afflict both scholarly writing —
If such a sublime cyborg would insinuate the
future as post-Fordist subject, his palpably
masochistic locations as ecstatic agent of the
sublime superstate need to be decoded as
the ""now all-but-unreadable DNA"" of the fast
industrializing Detroit, just as his Robocop-like
strategy of carceral negotiation and street
control remains the tirelessly American one
of inflicting regeneration through violence
upon the racially heteroglassic wilds and others
of the inner city.
— and prose as mainstream as The Village Voice's:
At first encounter, the poems' distanced
cerebral surfaces can be daunting, evading
physical location or straightforward emotional
arc. But this seeming remoteness quickly
reveals a very real passion, centered in the
speaker's struggle to define his evolving
self-construction.
Maybe it's a combination of my SNOOTitude and the fact that I end up having to read a lot of it for my job, but I'm afraid I regard Academic English not as a dialectal variation but as a grotesque debasement of SWE, and loathe it even more than the stilted incoherences of Presidential English (""This is the best and only way to uncover, destroy, and prevent Iraq from reengineering weapons of mass destruction"") or the mangled pieties of BusinessSpeak (""Our Mission: to proactively search and provide the optimum networking skills and resources to meet the needs of your growing business""); and in support of this utter contempt and intolerance I cite no less an authority than Mr. G. Orwell, who 50 years ago had AE pegged as a ""mixture of vagueness and sheer incompetence"" in which ""it is normal to come across long passages which are almost completely lacking in meaning.""
It probably isn't the whole explanation, but, as with the voguish hypocrisy of PCE, the obscurity and pretension of Academic English can be attributed in part to a disruption in the delicate rhetorical balance between language as a vector of meaning and language as a vector of the writer's own resume. In other words, it is when a scholar's vanity/insecurity leads him to write primarily to communicate and reinforce his own status as an Intellectual that his English is deformed by pleonasm and pretentious diction (whose function is to signal the writer's erudition) and by opaque abstraction (whose function is to keep anybody from pinning the writer down to a definite assertion that can maybe be refuted or shown to be silly). The latter characteristic, a level of obscurity that often makes it just about impossible to figure out what an AE sentence is really saying, so closely resembles political and corporate doublespeak (""revenue enhancement,"" ""downsizing,"" pre-owned,"" ""proactive resource-allocation restructuring"") that it's tempting to think AE's real purpose is concealment and its real motivation fear.
The insecurity that drives AE, PCE, and vocab-tape ads is far from groundless, though. These are tense linguistic times. Blame it on Heisenbergian Uncertainty or postmodern relativism or Image Over Substance or the ubiquity of advertising and P.R. or the rise of Identity Politics or whatever you will — we live in an era of terrible preoccupation with presentation and interpretation. In rhetorical terms, certain long-held distinctions between the Ethical Appeal, Logical Appeal (= an argument's plausibility or soundness), and Pathetic Appeal (= an argument's emotional impact) have now pretty much collapsed — or rather the different sorts of Appeals now affect and are affected by one another in ways that make it almost impossible to advance an argument on ""reason"" alone.
A vividly concrete illustration here concerns the Official Complaint a black undergraduate filed against this rev. after one of my little in camera spiels described on pages 53-54. The complainant was (I opine) wrong, but she was not crazy or stupid; and I was able later to see that I did bear some responsibility for the whole nasty administrative swivet. My culpability lay in gross rhetorical naivete. I'd seen my speech's primary Appeal as Logical: The aim was to make a conspicuously blunt, honest argument for SWE's utility. It wasn't pretty, maybe, but it was true, plus so manifestly bullshit-free that I think I anticipated not just acquiescence but gratitude for my candor.  The problem I failed to see, of course, lay not with the argument per se but with the person making it — namely me, a Privileged WASP Male in a position of power, thus someone whose statements about the primacy and utility of the Privileged WASP Male dialect appeared not candid/hortatory/ authoritative/true but elitist/high-handed/ authoritarian/racist. Rhetoric-wise what happened was that I allowed the substance and style of my Logical Appeal to completely torpedo my Ethical Appeal: What the student heard was just another PWM rationalizing why his Group and his English were top dog and ought ""logically"" to stay that way (plus, worse, trying to use his academic power over her to coerce her assent  ).
If for any reason you happen to find yourself sharing this particular student's perceptions and reaction,  I would ask that you bracket your feelings long enough to recognize that the PWM instructor's very modern rhetorical dilemma in that office was really no different from the dilemma faced by a male who makes a Pro-Life argument, or an atheist who argues against Creation Science, or a Caucasian who opposes Affirmative Action, or an African American who decries Racial Profiling, or anyone over eighteen who tries to make a case for raising the legal driving age to eighteen, etc. The dilemma has nothing to do with whether the arguments themselves are plausible or right or even sane, because the debate rarely gets that far — any opponent with sufficiently strong feelings or a dogmatic bent can discredit the arguments and pretty much foreclose all further discussion with a single, terribly familiar rejoinder: ""Of course you'd say that""; ""Easy for you to say""; ""What right do you have ...?""
Now (still bracketing) consider the situation of any reasonably intelligent and well-meaning SNOOT who sits down to prepare a prescriptive usage guide. It's the millennium, post-Everything: Whence the authority to make any sort of credible Appeal for SWE at all?
ARTICLE'S CRUX: WHY BRYAN A. GARNER IS A GENIUS, THOUGH OF A RATHER PARTICULAR KIND
It isn't that A Dictionary of Modern American Usage is perfect It doesn't seem to cover conversant in vs. conversant with, for example, or abstruse vs. obtuse, or to have anything on hereby and herewith (which I tend to use interchangeably but always have the uneasy feeling I'm screwing up). Garner's got a good discussion of used to but nothing on supposed to. Nor does he give any examples to help explain irregular participles and transitivity (""The light shone"" vs. ""I shined the light,"" etc.), and these would seem to be more important than, say, the correct spelling of huzzah or the plural of animalculum, both of which get discussed. Plus there's the VOGUE WORDS snafu and the absence of a pronunciation entry on trough.  In other words, a SNOOT is going to be able to find stuff to quibble about in any usage dictionary, and ADMAU is no exception.
But it's still really, really good — and not just lexicographically but rhetorically, politically (if it even makes sense to distinguish these any more). As a collection of judgments, ADMAU is in no way Descriptivist, but Garner structures his judgments very carefully to avoid the elitism and anality of traditional SNOGTitude. He does not deploy irony or scorn or caustic wit, nor tropes or colloquialisms or contractions ... or really any sort of verbal style at all. In fact, even though Garner talks openly about himself and uses the 1-S pronoun throughout the whole dictionary, his personality is oddly effaced, neutralized. It's like he's so bland he's barely there. E.g., as this reviewer was finishing the book's final entry, it struck me that I had no idea whether Bryan Garner was black or white, gay or straight, Democrat or Dittohead. What was even more striking was that I hadn't once wondered about any of this up to now; something about Garner's lexical persona kept me ever from asking where the guy was coming from or what particular agendas or ideologies were informing what he had admitted right up front were ""value judgments.""
Bryan Garner is a genius because the Dictionary of Modern American Usage pretty much resolves the Usage Wars' Crisis of Authority. Garner manages to control the compresence of rhetorical Appeals so cleverly that he appears able to transcend both Usage Wars camps and simply tell the truth, and in a way that does not torpedo his own credibility but actually enhances it. His argumentative strategy is totally brilliant and totally sneaky, and part of both qualities is that it usually doesn't seem like there's even an argument going on at all.
Garner recognizes something that neither of the dogmatic camps appears to get: Given 40 years of the Usage Wars, ""authority"" is no longer something a lexicographer can just presume ex officio. In fact, a large part of the project of any contemporary usage dictionary will consist in establishing this authority. If that seems rather obvious, be apprised that nobody before Garner seems to have figured it out — that the lexicographer's challenge now is to be not just accurate and comprehensive but credible. That in the absence of unquestioned Authority in language, the reader must now be moved or persuaded to grant a dictionary its authority, freely and for what appear to be good reasons.
Garner's A Dictionary of Modern American Usage is thus both a collection of information and a piece of Democratic rhetoric. Its goal is to recast the Prescriptivist's persona: The author presents himself as an authority not in an autocratic sense but in a technocratic sense. And the technocrat is not only a thoroughly modern and palatable image of Authority but also immune to the charges of elitism/classism that have hobbled traditional Prescriptivism.
Of course, Garner really is a technocrat. He's a lawyer, recall, and in ADMAU he consciously projects a sort of wise juridical persona: knowledgeable, dispassionate, fair, with an almost Enlightenment-grade passion for reason. His judgments about usage tend to be rendered like legal opinions — exhaustive citation of precedent (other dictionaries' judgments, published examples of actual usage) combined with clear, logical reasoning that's always informed by the larger consensual purposes SWE is meant to serve.
Also thoroughgoingly technocratic is Garner's approach to the issue of whether anybody's even going to be interested in his 700 pages of fine-pointed counsel. Like any specialist, he simply presumes that there are practical reasons why some people choose to concern themselves with SWE usage; and his attitude about the fact that most Americans ""could care less"" isn't scorn or disapproval but the phlegmatic resignation of a doctor or lawyer who realizes that he can give good advice but can't make you take it:
The reality I care about most is that some people
still want to use the language well. They
want to write effectively; they want to speak effectively.
They want their language to be graceful at times and
powerful at times. They want to understand how to
use words well, how to manipulate sentences, and how
to move about in the language without seeming to flail.
They want good grammar, but they want more: they
want rhetoric in the traditional sense.
That is, they want to use the language deftly so that
it's fit for their purposes.
It's now possible to see that all the autobiographical stuff in ADMAU's Preface does more than just humanize Mr. Bryan A. Garner. It also serves to detail the early and enduring passion that helps make someone a credible technocrat — we tend to like and trust experts whose expertise is born of a real love for their specialty instead of just a desire to be expert at something. In fact, it turns out that ADMAU's Preface quietly and steadily invests Garner with every single qualification of modern technocratic Authority: passionate devotion, reason, and accountability (recall ""in the interests of full disclosure, here are the ten critical points ...""), experience (""that, after years of working on usage problems, I've settled on""), exhaustive and tech-savvy research (""For contemporary usage, the files of our greatest dictionary makers pale in comparison with the fulltext search capabilities now provided by NEXIS and WESTLAW""), an even and judicious temperament (see e.g. this from HYPERCORRECTION: ""Sometimes people strive to abide by the strictest etiquette, but in the process behave inappropriately""  ), and the sort of humble integrity (for instance, including in one of the entries a past published usage-error of his own) that not only renders Garner likable but transmits the same kind of reverence for English that good jurists have for the law, both of which are bigger and more important than any one person.
Probably the most attractive thing about ADMAU's Ethical Appeal, though, is Garner's scrupulous consideration of the reader's concern about his (or her) own linguistic authority and rhetorical persona and ability to convince an Audience that he cares. Again and again, Garner frames his prescriptions in rhetorical terms, e.g.: ""To the writer or speaker for whom credibility is important, it's a good idea to avoid distracting any readers or listeners."" Dictionary of Modern American Usage's real thesis, in other words, is that the purposes of the expert authority and the purposes of the lay reader are identical, and identically rhetorical — which I submit is about as Democratic these days as you're going to get.
NOTES
1. With the advent of online databases, Garner has access to far more examples of actual usage than did Gilman, and he deploys them to great effect. (FYI, Oxford's 1996 New Fowler's Modern English Usage is also extremely comprehensive and good, but its emphasis is on British usage.)
2. Sorry about this phrase: I hate this phrase, too. This happens to be one of those very rare times when ""historical context"" is the phrase to use and there is no equivalent phrase that isn't even worse. (I actually tried ""lexico-temporal backdrop"" in one of the middle drafts, which I think you'll agree is not preferable.)
INTERPOLATION
The above  is motivated by the fact that this reviewer almost always sneers and/or winces when he sees ""historical context"" deployed in a piece of writing and thus hopes to head off any potential sneers/winces from the reader here, especially in an article about felicitous usage.
3. SNOOT (n) (highly colloq) is this reviewer's nuclear family's nickname a clef for a really extreme usage fanatic, the sort of person whose idea of Sunday fun is to look for mistakes in Safire's column's prose itself. This reviewer's family is roughly 70 percent SNOOT, which term itself derives from an acronym, with the big historical family joke being that whether S.N.O.O.T. stood for ""Sprachgefuhl Necessitates Our Ongoing Tendance"" or ""Syntax Nudniks of Our Time"" depended on whether or not you were one.
4. This is true in my own case at any rate — plus also the ""uncomfortable"" part. I teach college English part-time — mostly Lit, not Comp. But I am also so pathologically anal about(*) usage that every semester the same thing happens: The minute I have read my students' first set of papers, we immediately abandon the regular Lit syllabus and have a three-week Emergency Remedial Usage Unit, during which my demeanor is basically that of somebody teaching HIV prevention to intravenous-drug users. When it emerges (as it does, every time) that 95 percent of these intelligent upscale college students have never been taught, e.g., what a clause is or why a misplaced ""only"" can make a sentence confusing, I all but pound my head on the blackboard; I exhort them to sue their hometown school boards. The kids end up scared, both of me and for me.
(*) Editor's Note: Author insisted this phrase replace ""obsessed with"" and took umbrage at the suggestion that this change clearly demonstrated the very quality he wished to denigrate.
5. Please note that the strategically repeated 1-P pronoun is meant to iterate and emphasize that this reviewer is very much one too, a SNOOT, plus to connote the nuclear family mentioned supra. SNOOTitude runs in families. In ADMAU's Preface, Bryan Garner mentions both his father and grandfather and actually uses the word genetic, and it's probably true: 95 percent of the SNOOTs I know have at least one parent who is, by profession or temperament or both, a SNOOT. In my own case, my mom is a Comp teacher and has written remedial usage books and is a SNOOT of the most rabid and intractable sort. At least part of the reason I am a SNOOT is that for years Mom brainwashed us in all sorts of subtle ways. Here's an example. Family suppers often involved a game: If one of us children made a usage error. Mom would pretend to have a coughing fit that would go on and on until the relevant child had identified the relevant error and corrected it. It was all very self-ironic and lighthearted; but still, looking back, it seems a bit excessive to pretend that your child is actually denying you oxygen by speaking incorrectly. But the really chilling thing is that I now sometimes find myself playing this same ""game"" with my own students, complete with pretend pertussion.
INTERPOLATION
As something I'm all but sure Harper's will excise, I'll also insert that we even had a lighthearted but retrospectively chilling little family song that Mom and we little SNOOTlets would sing in the car on long trips while Dad silently rolled his eyes and drove (you have to remember the title theme of Underdog in order to follow the song):
When idiots in this world appear
And fail to be concise or clear
And solecisms rend the ear
The cry goes up both far and near
For Blunder Dog
Blunder Dog
Blunder Dog
Blunder Dog
(*)
(*) (Since this'll almost surely get cut, I'll admit that, yes, I, as a kid, was the actual author of this song. But by this time I'd been thoroughly brainwashed. And just about the whole car sang along. It was sort of our family's version of ""100 Bottles ... Wall."")
6. If Samuel Johnson is the Shakespeare of English usage, think of Henry Watson Fowler as the Eliot or Joyce. His 1926 A Dictionary of Modern English Usage is the granddaddy of modern usage guides, and its dust-dry wit and blushless imperiousness have been models for every subsequent classic in the field, from Eric Partridge's Usage and Abusage to Theodore Bernstein's The Careful Writer to Wilson Follett's Modern American Usage to Gilman's '89 Webster's.
7. (Garner prescribes spelling out only numbers under ten. I was taught that this rule applies just to Business Writing and that in all other modes you spell out one through nineteen and start using cardinals at 20.(*) De gustibus non est disputandum.)
(*) Editor's Note: The Harper's style manual prescribes spelling out all numbers up to 100.
8. From personal experience, I can assure you that any kid like this is going to be at best marginalized and at worst savagely and repeatedly Wedgied.
Back
9. What follow in the Preface are ""... the ten critical points that, after years of working on usage problems, I've settled on."" These points are too involved to treat separately, but a couple of them are slippery in the extreme — e.g., ""10. Actual Usage. In the end, the actual usage of educated speakers and writers is the over arching criterion for correctness,"" of which both ""educated"" and ""actual"" would require several pages of abstract clarification and qualification to shore up against Usage Wars-related attacks, but which Garner rather ingeniously elects to define and defend via their application in his dictionary itself.
10. There's no better indication of The Dictionary's authority than that we use it to settle wagers. My own father is still to this day living down the outcome of a high-stakes bet on the correct spelling of meringue, a wager made on 14 September 1978.
11. Editor's Note: The Harper's style manual prescribes okay.
12. This is a clever half-truth. Linguists compose only one part of the anti-judgment camp, and their objections to usage judgments involve way more than just ""subjectivity.""
13. In this last respect, recall for example W. J. Clinton's famous ""I feel your pain,"" which was a blatant if not particularly masterful Ethical Appeal.
14. Really, howled, blistering reviews and outraged editorials from across the country — from the Times and The New Yorker and good old Life, or q.v. this from the January '62 Atlantic: ""We have seen a novel dictionary formula improvised, in great part, out of snap judgments and the sort of theoretical improvement that in practice impairs; and we have seen the gates propped wide open in enthusiastic hospitality to miscellaneous confusions and corruptions. In fine, the anxiously awaited work that was to have crowned cisatlantic linguistic scholarship with a particular glory turns out to be a scandal and a disaster.""
15. Note for example the mordant pith (and royal we) of this random snippet from Partridge's Usage and Abusage:
anxious of. `I am not hopeless of our future. But I am
profoundly anxious of it', Beverley Nichols, News of England,
1938: which made us profoundly anxious For (or about)
— not of — Mr Nichols's literary future.
Or see the near-Himalayan condescension of Fowler, here on some other people's use of words to mean things the words don't really mean:
slipshod extension ... is especially likely to occur
when some accident gives currency among the
uneducated to words of learned origin, & the more
if they are isolated or have few relatives in the
vernacular.... The original meaning of feasible is
simply doable (L facere do); but to the unlearned
it is a mere token, of which he has to infer the value
from the contexts in which he hears it used, because
such relatives as it has in English — Feat, feature,
faction, &c. — either fail to show the obvious
family likeness to which he is accustomed among
families of indigenous words, or are (like malfeasance)
outside his range.
16. Utter bushwa: As ADMAU's body makes clear, Garner knows exactly when the Descriptivists started influencing language guides.
17. (which in fact is true)
18. (Q.v. ""The Pharmakon"" in Derrida's La dissemination — but you'd probably be better off just trusting me.)
19. Standard Written English (SWE) is also sometimes called Standard English (SE) or Educated English, but the inditement-emphasis is the same.
SEMI-INTERPOLATION
Plus note that Garner's Preface explicitly names ADMAU's intended audience as ""writers and editors."" And even ads for the dictionary in such organs as The New York Review of Books are built around the slogan ""If you like to WRITE ... Rear to us.""(*)
(*) (Yr. SNOOT rev. cannot help observing, w/r/t these ads, that the opening r in Refer here should not be capitalized after a dependent clause + ellipses — Quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus.)
20. True, some sort of 100 percent compendious real-time Mega-dictionary might be possible online, though it'd take a small army of lexical webmasters and a much larger army of in situ actual-use reporters and surveillance techs; plus it'd be GNP-level expensive.
21. New Criticism refers to T. S. Eliot and I. A. Richards and F. R. Leavis and Cleanth Brooks and Wimsatt & Beardsley and the whole ""close reading"" school that dominated literary criticism from WWI well into the seventies.
22. (""EVIDENCE OF CANCER LINK REFUTED BY TOBACCO INSTITUTE RESEARCHERS"")
23. This proposition is in fact true, as is interpolatively demonstrated below, and although the demonstration is extremely persuasive it is also, as you can see from the size of this FN, lengthy and involved and rather, umm, dense, so that again you'd probably be better off simply granting the truth of the proposition and forging on with the main text.
INTERPOLATIVE DEMONSTRATION OF THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A PRIVATE LANGUAGE
It's sometimes tempting to imagine that there can be such a things as Private Language. Many of us are prone to lay-philosophising about the weird privacy of our own mental states, for example, and from the fact that when my knee hurts only I can feel it, it's tempting to conclude that for me the word pain has a very subjective internal meaning that only I can truly understand. This line of thinking is sort of like the adolescent pot-smoker's terror that his own inner experience is both private and unverifiable, a syndrome that is techinically known as Cannabalic Solipsism. Eating ChipsAhoy! and staring very intently at the television's network PGA event, for instance, the adolescent potsmoker is struck by ghastly possibility that, e.g., what he sees as the color green and what other people call ""the color green"" may in fact not be the same color experiences at all The fact that both he and someone else call Pebble Beach's fairways green and a stoplight's GO signal green appears to guarantee only that there is a similar consistency in their color experience of fairways and GO lights, not that the actual subjective quality of those color experiences is the same; it could be that what the ad. pot-smoker experiences as green everyone else actually experiences as blue, and what we ""mean"" by the Word blue is what he ""means"" by green, etc., etc., until the Whole line of thinking gets so vexed and exhausting that the a.p.-s, ends up slumped crumb-strewn and paralyzed in his chair.
The point here is that the idea of a Private Language, like Private Colors and most of the other solipsistic conceits with which this particular reviewer has at various times been afflicted, is both deluded and demonstrably false.
In the case of Private Language, the delusion is usually based on the belief that a word such as pain has the meaning it does because it is somehow ""connected"" to a feeling in my knee. But as Mr. L. Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations proved in the 1950s, words actually have the meanings they do because of certain rules and verification tests that are imposed on us from outside our own subjectivities, viz., by the community in which we have to get along and communicate with other people. Wittgenstein's argument, which is admittedly very complex and gnomic and opaque, basically centers on the fact that a word like ""pain"" means what it does for me because of the way the community I'm part of has tacitly agreed to use ""pain"".
If you're thinking that all this fuss is not only abstract but also pretty irrelevant to the Usage Wars or to anything you have any real interest in at all, you are very much mistaken. If words' meanings depend on transpersonal rules and these rules on community consensus, language is not only conceptually non-Private but also irreducibly public, political, and ideological. This means that questions about our national consensus on grammar and usage arc actually bound up with every last social issue that millennial America's about — class, race, gender, morality, tolerance, pluralism, cohesion, equality, fairness, money: You name it.
24. Norms, after all, are just practices people have agreed on as optimal ways of doing things for certain purposes. They're not laws, but they're not laissez-faire, either.
25. In his The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language (1994), Steven Pinker puts it this way: ""No one, not even a valley girl, has to be told not to say 'Apples the eat boy' or 'The child seems sleeping' or 'Who did you meet John and?' or the vast, vast majority of the millions of trillions of mathematically possible combinations of words.
26. In the Case of Steve Pinker Jr., those people are the boy's peers and teachers and crossing guards etc. In the case of adult cross-dressers and drag queens who have jobs in the Straight World and wear pants to those jobs, it's coworkers and clients and people on the subway. For the die-hard slob who nevertheless wears a coat and a tie to work, it's mostly his boss, who himself doesn't want his employee's clothes to send clients ""the wrong message."" But of course it's all basically the same thing.
27. In fact, the only time one ever hears the issue made explicit is in radio ads for tapes that promise to improve people's vocabulary. These ads are extremely ominous and intimidating and always start out with ""DID YOU KNOW PEOPLE JUDGE YOU BY THE WORDS YOU USE?
28. (... not to mention color, gender, creed — you can see how fraught and charged all this is going to get)
29. Discourse Community is an example of that rare kind of academic jargon that's actually a valuable addition to SWE because it captures something at once very complex and very specific that no other English term quite can.(*)
(*) (The above is an obvious attempt to preempt readerly sneers/winces at the term's continued deployment in this article.)
30. (Plus it's true that whether something gets called a ""subdialect"" or ""jargon"" seems to depend on how much it annoys people outside its Discourse Community. Garner himself has miniessays on AIRLINESE, COMPUTERESE, LEGALESE, and BUREAUCRATESE, and he more or less calls all of them jargon. There is no ADMAU miniessay on DIALECTS, but there is one On JARGON, in which such is Garner's self-restraint that you can almost hear his tendons straining, as in ""  arises from the urge to save time and space — and occasionally to conceal meaning from the uninitiated."")
31. (a redundancy that's a bit arbitrary, since ""Where's it from?"" isn't redundant )
32. A synthetic language uses inflections to dictate syntax, whereas an analytic language uses word order. Latin, German, and Russian are synthetic; English and Chinese, analytic.
33. (Q.v. for example Sir Thomas Smith's cortex-withering De Recta et Emendata Linguae Anglicae Scriptione Dialogus of 1568.)
34. But note that he's sane about it. Some split infinitives really are clunky and hard to parse, especially when there are a whole bunch of words between to and the verb — ""We will attempt to swiftly and to the best of our ability respond to these charges"" — which Garner calls ""wide splits"" and sensibly discourages. His overall verdict on s.i.'s — which is that some are ""perfectly proper"" and some iffy and some just totally bad news, and that no one wide tidy dogmatic ukase can handle all s.i. cases, and thus that ""knowing when to split an infinitive requires a good ear and a keen eye"" — is a good example of the way Garner distinguishes sound and helpful Descriptivist objections from wacko or dogmatic objections and then incorporates the sound objections into a smarter and more flexible Prescriptivism.
35. The SNOOTlet is, as it happens, an indispensable part of other kids' playground education. The kids are learning that a Group's identity depends as much on exclusion as inclusion. They are, in other words, starting to learn about Us and Them, and about how an Us always needs a Them because being not-Them is essential to being Us. Because they're kids and it's school, the obvious Them is the teachers and all the values and appurtenances of the teacher world. This teacher-Them helps the kids see how to start to be an Us, but the SNOOTlet completes the puzzle by providing the as it were missing link: He is the Traitor, the Us who is in fact not Us but Them.
In sum, the SNOOTier is teaching his peers that the criteria for membership in Us are not just age, station, inability to stay up past 9:00, etc. — that in fact Us is primarily a state of mind and a set of sensibilities. An ideology.
36. (The skirt-in-school scenario was not personal stuff, FYI.)
37. There are still Some of these teachers around, at least here in the Midwest. YOU know the type: lipless, tweedy, cancrine — Old Maids of both genders. If you had one (as I did, 1976-77), you surely remember him.
38. (Or require us openly to acknowledge and talk about elitism, whereas a dogmatic SNOOT's pedagogy is merely elitism in action.)
39. (I'm not a total idiot.)
40. E.g., this is the reasoning behind many Pop Prescriptivists' complaint that shoddy usage signifies the Decline of Western Civilization.
41. A Dictionary of Modern American Usage includes a miniessay on VOGUE WORDS, but it's a disappointing one in that Garner does little more than list VW's that bug him and say that ""vogue words have such a grip on the popular mind that they come to be used in contexts in which they serve little purpose."" This is one of the rare places in ADMAU where Garner is simply wrong. The real problem is that every sentence blends and balances at least two different communicative functions — one the transmission of raw info, the other the transmission of certain stuff about the speaker — and Vogue Usage throws this balance off. Garher's ""serve little purpose"" is exactly incorrect; vogue words serve too much the purpose of presenting the speaker in a certain light (even if this is merely as with-it or hip), and people's subliminal B.S.-antennae pick this imbalance up, and that's why even nonSNOOTs often find Vogue Usage irritating and creepy.
42. FYI, this passage, which appears in ADMAU's entry on OBSCURITY, is quoted from a 1997 Sacramento Bee article entitled ""No Contest: English Professors Are Worst Writers on Campus.""
43. This was in his 1946 ""Politics and the English Language,"" an essay that despite its date (and its title's basic redundancy) remains the definitive SNOOT statement on Academese. Orwell's famous AE translation of the gorgeous ""I saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift"" in Ecclesiastes as ""Objective considerations of contemporary phenomena compel the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account"" should be tattooed on the left wrist of every grad student in the anglophone world.
44. Please just don't even say it.
45. (She professed to have been especially traumatized by the climactic ""I am going to make you,"" which in retrospect was indeed a mammoth rhetorical boner.)
46. (The Dept. head and Dean did not, as it happens, share her reaction ... though it would be disingenuous not to tell you that they happened also to be PWM's, which fact did not go unremarked by the complainant, such that the whole proceeding got pretty darn tense, indeed, before it was all over.)
47. To be honest, I noticed this omission only because midway through working on this article I happened to use the word trough in front of the same SNOOT friend who Likes to compare public English to violin-hammering, and he fell sideways out of his chair, and it emerged that I have somehow all my life misheard trough as ending with a th instead of an f and thus have publicly mispronounced it God knows how many scores of times, and I all but burned rubber getting home to see whether perhaps the error was so common and human and understandable that Garner himself had a good-natured entry on it, but no such luck which in fairness I don't suppose I can really blame Garner for.
48. (on zwieback vs. zweiback)
49. (meaning literally Democratictic — it Wants Your Vote)
50. The last two words of this sentence, of course, are what the Usage Wars are about — whose ""language"" and whose ""well""? The most remarkable thing about this sentence is that coming from Garner it doesn't sound naive or obnoxious but just ... reasonable.
51. Did you think I was kidding?
52. (Here this reviewer's indwelling and ever-vigilant SNOOT can't help but question why Garner uses a comma before the conjunction in this sentence, since what follows the conjunction is neither an independent clause nor any kind of plausible complement for strive to. But respectful disagreement between people of goodwill is of course Democratically natural and healthy and, when you come right down to it, kind of fun.)

It's sometimes tempting to imagine that there can be such a things as Private Language.

Tenement slum (Tenement slum)
My father left, he never even married Mom
I shared the guilt my mama knew
So afraid that others knew I had no name

Is worth the pain of waiting
We'll only end up hating
The child we may be creating

Love child, never meant to be (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)

(Hold on, hold on, just a little bit longer) Mmm, baby

I knew the way it felt to always live in doubt
To be without the simple things
So afraid my friends would see the guilt in me

Don't think I don't wanna please you
But no child of mine will be bearing
The name of shame I've been wearing

Love child, love child, never quite as good (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
Afraid, ashamed, misunderstood (Just a little bit longer, love child)

But I can tell you, people
They were the devil's children
Bonnie and Clyde began their evil doing
One lazy afternoon
Down Savannah way
They robbed a store
And high-tailed out of that town
Got clean away in a stolen car
And waited till the heat died down
Bonnie and Clyde advanced their reputation
And made the graduation
Into the banking business
Reach for the sky!
Sweet talking Clyde would holler
As Bonnie loaded dollars
In the dewlap bag
Now one brave man
He tried to take them alone
They left him lying in a pool of blood
And laughed about it all the way home
Bonnie and Clyde got to be public enemy number one
Running and hiding from every American lawman's gun
They used to laugh about dying
But deep inside them they knew
That pretty soon they'd be lying
Beneath the ground together
Pushing up daisies to welcome the sun and the morning dew
Acting upon reliable information
A Federal Deputation laid a deadly ambush
When Bonnie and Clyde came walking in the sunshine
A half a dozen carbines opened up on them
Bonnie and Clyde
They lived a lot together
And finally together
They died"

We lost our starry notions on the way

As you know, gentlemen, Dr. Evil had
Himself frozen in 1967.  Soon after
Austin Powers volunteered to have
Himself frozen, in the event Dr
Evil should ever return.  We believe
Dr. Evil has begun yet another plot

No, he worked freelance, an
Internationally renowned swinging
Photographer by day and the ultimate
Gentlemen spy by night
Finally, they come across Austin Powers: He is naked.  His
Hands cover up his private parts.  The look on his face
Suggests 'Oh my God, my bits and pieces are cold'.  His

Well, as long as people are still
Having promiscuous sex with many
Anonymous partners without protection
While at the same time experimenting
With mind-expanding

I wanted to travel -- see the world
In my last year I was accepted into

Exciting career, but my job was to
Read everything printed in every

And be honest
VANESSA
Sure
AUSTIN
Do I make you horny?
VANESSA
What?
AUSTIN
Do I make you horny?  Randy, you
Know.  To you, am I eros manifest?
VANESSA
I hope this is part of the unfreezing
Process
AUSTIN
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger&emdash;
That's what I do, I swing
VANESSA
I understand that, Mr. Powers, but
Let me be perfectly clear with you
Perhaps to the point of being
Insulting.  I will never have sex
With you, ever.  If you were the
Last man on Earth and I was the last
Woman on Earth, and the future of
The human race depended on our having
Sex simply for procreation, I still
Would not have sex with you
Austin is oblivious
AUSTIN
What's you point, Vanessa?

You've got mail!
ANGLE ON:  the computer screen.  It's Basil Exposition
BASIL EXPOSITION
Hello Austin.  Hello Vanessa.  This
Is Basil Exposition, from British
Intelligence
There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think
May be linked to Dr. Evil.  Many of the Virtucon executives
Gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying.  That's
The first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat
Rooms
AUSTIN
Thank you, Exposition
BASIL EXPOSITION
Oh, and Austin...
AUSTIN
Yes?
BASIL EXPOSITION
Be careful
Vanessa closes her lap-top
PILOT
(over loudspeaker)
Ladies and gentlemen, we're beginning
Our final descent into Las Vegas
International Airport.  Flight
Attendants will be coming by to
Collect your drinks, and I'll ask
You at this time to please return to
The main cabin and put your
Bean-bags in the upright position
Austin and Vanessa fasten the seatbelts on their bean bags

INT.  DR. EVIL'S PRIVATE QUARTERS
DR. EVIL
(face again unseen)
Ladies and Gentlemen, it's been a
Long time, but I'm back.  It's all
Gone perfectly to plan except for
One small flaw.  Because of a
Technical error, my right arm was
Not frozen.  I was therefore by
Definition only partially frozen
ANGLE ON EVIL ASSOCIATE MUSTAFA.  He is terrified and sweaty
Eyes darting left and right
MUSTAFA
But my design was perfect!  Your
Autonomic functions were shut down
And even though your arm wasn't
Frozen, the aging was retarded
Therefore your right arm is only
Slightly older than the left
DR. EVIL
Can't you see I'm only half a man?
Look at me, I'm a freak!
He holds up his older right arm, which looks normal
MUSTAFA
But Dr. Evil, all you need to do
Is&emdash;
(holding up tennis
Ball)
--work with this tennis ball.  Squeeze
It for twenty minutes a day.  A few
Months of that and it'll be just as
Strong as the other arm...
DR. EVIL
And look what you've done to Mr
Bigglesworth!
ANGLE ON MR. BIGGLESWORTH
Who is now totally hairless, with a fringe of white hair
Around it's ears, like Dr. Evil himself
MUSTAFA
We could not anticipate feline
Complications due to the reanimation
Process&emdash;
DR. EVIL

Silence!
ANGLE ON A HAND WITH DR. EVIL'S RING ON IT
Dr. Evil presses a button.  Mustafa's chair tips back and he
Falls backwards into a pit
MUSTAFA
(blood-curdling scream)
Ahhhhhhhhh!
DR. EVIL
(face unseen)
Let this be a reminder to you all
That this organization will not
Tolerate failure
MUSTAFA'S SCREAMS ECHO FAINTLY
ANGLE ON:  DR. EVIL FOR THE FIRST TIME.  HE IS IN HIS EARLY
FIFTIES AND IS BALD, WITH A HIDEOUS
Scar on his cheek
DR. EVIL
Gentlemen, let's get down to business
More muffled SCREAMS
DR. EVIL
We've got a lot of work to do
MUSTAFA (O.S.)
(muffled)
Someone help me!  I'm still alive
Only I'm very badly burned
DR. EVIL
(slightly distracted)
Some of you I know, some of you I'm
Meeting for the first time
MUSTAFA (O.S.)
(muffled)
Hello up there!  Anyone!  Can someone
Call an ambulance?  I'm in quite a
Lot of pain
DR. EVIL
(very frustrated)
You've all been gathered here to
Form my Evil Cabinet.  Excuse me
He picks up a white phone and MURMURS into it
MUSTAFA (O.S.)
(muffled)
If somebody can open the retrieval
Hatch down here, I could get out
See, I designed this device myself
And...oh, hi!  Good, I'm glad you
Found me.  Listen, I'm very badly
Burned, so if you could just&emdash;
SFX:  Muffled Gunshot
MUSTAFA (O.S.)

Ow!  You shot me!
DR. EVIL
Right.  Okay.  Moving on
MUSTAFA (O.S.)
(muffled)
You shot me right in the arm!  Why
Did&emdash; SFX:  Muffled Gunshot
Dr. Evil waits.  Nothing
DR. EVIL
Let me go around the table and
Introduce everyone.  Frau
Farbissina...

The Salvation Army.  Random Task...
RANDOM TASK is a large Korean man in a butler's uniform
DR. EVIL
...a Korean ex-wrestler, evil handyman
Extraordinaire.  Show them what you
Do
He stands up, bows, then takes off his shoe and THROWS it.  It knocks the head off a sculpture across the room
DR. EVIL
Thank you, Random Task.  Patty
O'Brien...
PATTY O'BRIEN, a small, wiry Irishman with fiery eyes
DR. EVIL
...ex-Irish assassin.  His trademark?
Around PATTY O'BRIENS WRIST is a charm bracelet
DR. EVIL
A superstitious man, he leaves a
Tiny keepsake on every victim he
Kills.  Scotland Yard would love to
Get their hands on that piece of
Evidence
PATTY O'BRIEN
(heavy Irish accent)
Yes, they're always after me lucky
Charms!
Everyone in the room tries to keep a straight face
PATTY O'BRIEN
What?  What?  Why does everyone always
Laugh when I say that?  They are
After me lucky charms
They cannot contain their LAUGHTER
PATTY O'BRIEN
(angry)
What?
FRAU FARBISSINA
(through suppressed
Laughter)
It's a television commercial with
This little cartoon Leprechaun who
Is a benevolent imp who is very
Concerned that these children will
Steal his lucky charms which are
Foodstuffs fashioned into various
Shapes&emdash; hearts, moons, clovers
What have you...
(pause)
It's a long story
DR. EVIL
Finally, I come to my number two
Man.  His name:  Number Two
NUMBER TWO, a good-looking 40-year-old man with an eye-patch
DR. EVIL
For thirty years, Number Two has run
Virtucon, the legitimate face of my
Evil empire
He hits a button.  The conference table slowly rotates to
Reveal a large, illuminated map of the United States dotted
By various miniature models
NUMBER TWO
Over the last thirty years, Virtucon
Has grown by leaps and bounds.  About
Fifteen years ago, we changed from
Volatile chemicals to the
Communication industry.  We own cable companies in thirty-eight states...
The thirty-eight states illuminate on the map
NUMBER TWO
...in addition to our cable holdings, we own a steel mill in Cleveland...
A steel mill miniature illuminates in Cleveland

...Oil refineries in Seattle...
An oil refinery illuminates in Seattle
NUMBER TWO
And a factory in Chicago that makes miniature models of factories.
The miniature model factory lights up in Chicago
NUMBER TWO
We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors
(holds up plate)
Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
DR. EVIL
Gentlemen, I have a plan.  It's called blackmail.  The Royal Family of
Britain are the wealthiest landowners In the world.  Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
There is an uncomfortable silence
NUMBER TWO
Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair.  He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.
DR. EVIL
People have to tell me these things! I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.
(pausing)
OK, no problem.  Here's my second plan.  Back in the Sixties I had a
weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a ""laser.""  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the ""Ozone Layer.""  Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer.  That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom.
There is another uncomfortable silence
NUMBER TWO
Umm, that also has already happened
DR. EVIL
Right
(pause)
Oh, hell, let's just do what we always
Do.  Let's hijack some nuclear weapons
And hold the world hostage
(pause)
Gentlemen, it's come to my attention
That a breakaway Russian Republic
Called Kreplachistan will be
Transferring a nuclear warhead to
The United Nations in a few days
Here's the plan.  We get the warhead
And we hold the world ransom...
(dramatic pause)
...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
There is an uncomfortable pause
NUMBER TWO
Don't you think we should ask for
More than a million dollars?  A
Million dollars isn't that much money
These days
DR. EVIL
All right then...
(dramatic pause)
...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!
There is another uncomfortable pause
NUMBER TWO
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion
Dollars a year
DR. EVIL
(pleasantly surprised)
Oh, really?
(slightly irritated)
One-hundred billion dollars
(pause)
OK, make it happen.  Anything else?
FRAU FARBISSINA
Remember when we froze your semen
You said that if it looked like you
Weren't coming back to try and make
You a son so that a part of you would
Live forever?
DR. EVIL
Yes
FRAU FARBISSINA
Well, after a few years, we got sort
Of impatient.  Dr. Evil, I want you
To meet your son
DR. EVIL
My son?
FRAU FARBISSINA
Yes
(calling out)
Scott!
SCOTT EVIL walks out.  He is fifteen, grungy, and wears a
Kurt Cobain T-shirt
SCOTT EVIL
Hi
DR. EVIL
Hello, Scott.  I'm your father, Dr
Evil
(emotional)
I have a son!  I have a son!
Everyone, I have a son!

Someday, Scott, this will all be
Yours

I haven't seen you my whole life and
Now you show up and want a
Relationship?  I hate you!

This
The glove compartment revolves to reveal a display of various
Dental hygiene products&emdash; floss, toothpaste, toothbrush
Dental mirror, and cleaning tool
AUSTIN
Let me guess.  The floss is garotte
Wire, the toothpaste contains plastic
Explosives, and the toothbrush is
The detonation device

No, actually.  I don't know how to
Put this really.  Well, there have
Been fabulous advances in the field

VANESSA
You're going to sleep on the sofa. I'd like to remind you, Mr. Powers, that the only reason we're sharing a room is to support our cover story that we're a married couple on vacation.
AUSTIN
So, shall we shag now, or shall we
Shag later?  How do you like to do
It?  Do you like to wash up first?
Top and tails?  A whore's bath?
Personally, before I'm on the job, I
Like to give my undercarriage a bit
Of a how's-your-father

I'm just joking, Vanessa.  Trying to
Get a rise out of you

This isn't mine

So that we don't draw attention to
Ourselves

Austin and Vanessa join the high-rollers table.  Number Two

Too right, youth
INT.  BATHROOM STALL
Austin sits down.  Behind him, a panel SLIDES OPEN, revealing
Patty O'Brien.  His charm bracelet JINGLES.  Austin looks
Back.  Patty's bracelet is now garotte wire.  He wraps it
Around Austin's throat.  Austin gets his thumbs between the
Wire and certain death
AUSTIN
(grunting)
Uh, uh!
INT.  TEXAN'S STALL
The Texan can only see Austin's feet, which are moving about
Frantically.  He can hear the
GRUNTING
TEXAN
Hey pardner, just relax, don't force
It!  Use some creative visualization
INT.  AUSTIN'S STALL
Austin GRUNTS and snaps his head back into Patty O'Brien's
Crotch.  Patty O'Brien GROANS in agony
PATTY O'BRIEN

Ughhhhh...
Austin breaks free of the charm bracelet/garotte, grabs Patty
O'Brien's head, and pulls it between his legs so that it
Hovers above the toilet bowl

Hear MUFFLED GURGLING SOUNDS from Patty O'Brien

He's asleep
MRS. KENSINGTON
You didn't...
INT.  HOTEL SUITE
VANESSA
Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the
Couch
In the background, we see Austin get off the couch.  He is     very naked and very hairy.  A strategically placed vase of      flowers blocks his naughty bits from view
MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
I'm proud of you
VANESSA
Why?
MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
Because you managed to resist Austin
Power's charms
Austin moves towards the bathroom away from the flowers.      Right in the nick of time, Vanessa holds up a photo of Number      Two and looks at it, blocking his naughty parts
VANESSA
Well, God knows he tried, but I've
Been rather firm with him, Mummy
You didn't tell me he was so obsessed
With sex.  It's bizarre
MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
You can't judge him by modern
Standards.  He's very much a product
Of his times.  In my day he could
Have any woman he wanted
VANESSA
What about his teeth?
SPLIT SCREEN - HOTEL ROOM/MRS. KENSINGTON'S HOUSE
MRS. KENSINGTON
You have to understand, in Britain
In the Sixties you could be a sex
Symbol and still have bad teeth.  It
Didn't matter
VANESSA
I just don't see it
MRS. KENSINGTON
Just wait.  Once Austin gets you in
His charms, it's impossible to get
Out
VANESSA
Did you ever...
MRS. KENSINGTON
Of course not.  I was married to
Your father
VANESSA
Did you ever want to?
MRS. KENSINGTON
Austin is very charming, very
Debonair.  He's handsome, witty, has
A knowledge of fine wines
Sophisticated, a world-renowned

Austin re-enters from left to right, still NAKED.  Vanessa       holds up Austin's Fab Magazine shoot from the Sixties, and          in perfect timing blocks his crotch from the camera
VANESSA
You didn't answer my question, Mum
MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
I know.  Let me just say this: Austin
Was the most loyal and caring friend
I ever had
I will always love him
AUSTIN (V.O.)
Good morning, luv, who are you on
The phone with?

'hey, why don't we run down the hill
And shag us a cow?', and the wise
Old bull replies, 'no, why don't we
Walk down the hill and shag all the

To which it's a speck.  H puts it on the fork and offers it
To her
AUSTIN
Fancy a nibble?
VANESSA
I couldn't have another bite
They laugh.  They drink.  It's TOM JONES, serenading them
They begin to dance
Austin gives her roses.  Austin is wooing her
EXT.  LAS VEGAS STREET - NIGHT
They walk along the brightly-lit streets, laughing, enjoying
Each other's company.  Austin gives Vanessa a pet rock.  She
Graciously accepts

INT.  HOTEL ROOM
Sounds of MOANS and GROANS.  We see Austin's backside sticking
Out above a piece of furniture, then Vanessa's high-heeled
Leg straining upwards
VANESSA (O.S.)
Watch out, you're on my hair!
AUSTIN (O.S.)
Sorry.  Move your hand to the left
There you go.  Gorgeous
VANESSA (O.S.)
Go!  Just go!
We hear a SPINNING SOUND
AUSTIN (O.S.)
Left hand, blue
We now see that Austin and Vanessa are playing TWISTER.  She
Reaches for left hand blue and they fall over, laughing
AUSTIN
Wait a tick, I forgot something in
The lobby
(moving behind the
Couch)
I know what.  I'll take the stairs
Behind the couch, Austin mimes going down stairs
AUSTIN
Maybe I'll take the escalator
Austin mimes the smooth descent of an escalator
AUSTIN
Why take the escalator when I could
Take a canoe?
Austin mimes rowing a canoe behind the couch
VANESSA
I haven't had fun like that since
College
AUSTIN
I'm sorry
VANESSA
Why?
AUSTIN
I'm sorry that bug up your ass had
To die
She laughs too much, making a SNORTING sound
VANESSA
Always wanting to have fun, that's
You in a nutshell
AUSTIN
No, this is me in a nutshell
Austin mimes being trapped in a nutshell
AUSTIN
Help!  I'm in a nutshell!  What kind
Of nut has such a big nutshell?  How
Did I get into this bloody great big
Nutshell?
Vanessa laughs again, SNORTING, tipsy
AUSTIN
You're smashed, Vanessa
VANESSA
I am not
AUSTIN
Oh, yes you are
VANESSA
I'm not.  I'm the sensible one.  I'm
Always the designated driver
They are both on the bed.  She looks at him.  He looks at
Her.  There is an awkward silence
She's about to kiss him, then he pulls away
AUSTIN
I can't.  You're drunk
VANESSA
It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just
Beginning to see what my Mum was
Talking about
(pause)
What was my mother like back in the
Sixties?  I'm dying to know
AUSTIN
(sentimental)
She was very groovy.  She was so in
Love with your Dad.  If there was
One
Other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and
Treated her as well as you Dad did, it was me.  But
Unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed
Austin hears SNORING.  He looks over and sees Vanessa asleep
A distinctive PHONE RINGS and a

Austin opens one of his funky suitcases to reveal a PICTURE
PHONE.  It's Basil Exposition, on an airplane
BASIL EXPOSITION
(on the picture phone)
Hello, Austin, this is Basil
Exposition from British Intelligence
Thank you for confirming the link
Between Dr. Evil and Virtucon.  Find
Out what part Virtucon plays in
Something called Project Vulcan
I'll need you and Vanessa to get on
That immediately
AUSTIN
Right away, Exposition
BASIL EXPOSITION
Where is Vanessa, by the way?
Austin looks over at Vanessa's sleeping figure
AUSTIN
She's working on another lead right
Now
BASIL EXPOSITION
Then you'll have to go it alone
Good luck
AUSTIN
Thank you, Basil
BASIL EXPOSITION
Oh, and Austin...
AUSTIN

Yes?
BASIL EXPOSITION
Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
AUSTIN
Oh, yes.  Thank you.

Give it to me baby.  Super
We now see that the document outlines all of Virtucon's

AUSTIN
Pout for me, luv.  Smashing.  Yes!
Yes!  Yes!  No!  No!
One side of the chart is labeled ""Secret Projects.""  Under

And in CLOSE-UP&emdash; ""Project Vulcan.""
We see schematics for some sort of subterranean probe and a
Cross-section of the earth labeled ""Crust, Mantel, Core.""
AUSTIN
And I'm spent
The front door opens.  It's Alotta
AUSTIN
You seem surprised to see me
ALOTTA
I thought you'd quit while you were
Ahead
AUSTIN
What, and watch all my earnings go...
(smug)
Down the toilet?
ALOTTA
What do you want, Mr...Cunningham
Was it?
AUSTIN
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina.  May I
Call you Alotta...
(pause)
Please?
ALOTTA
You may
AUSTIN
Your boss, Number Two, I understand
That cat's involved in big underground
Drills
ALOTTA
Virtucon's main interest is in cable
Television, but they do have a
Subterranean construction division
Yes.  How did you know?
AUSTIN
(smug)
I didn't, baby, you just told me
ALOTTA
It's for the mining industry, Mr
Cunningham.  We can talk about
Business later.  But first, let me
Slip into something more comfortable
AUSTIN
Behave!

Alotta goes behind a Japanese screen.  In silhouette she
Takes off her clothes and puts on a robe.  She opens a pair
Of sliding doors to reveal an elaborate Japanese bath grotto
INT.  JAPANESE BATH
She slips off her robe, revealing a DR. EVIL LOGO TATTOO on
Her shoulder, and enters the water
ALOTTA
Come in

I'd rather talk about Number Two
ALOTTA
Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham?
Come in, and I'll show you everything
You need to know
Austin takes off his clothes.  He is extremely hairy.  He
Goes in.  Alotta produces a soapy sponge and swims over
ALOTTA
May I wash you?
AUSTIN
Groovy
She washes his back.  Behind his back, she pulls out his
Wallet and looks through it.  ANGLE ON HIS IDENTIFICATION
It reads ""AUSTIN POWERS, INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY.""
ANGLE ON HIS VARIOUS CARDS:  CHARGEX, PLAYBOY CLUB, ETC
SHE PUTS HIS WALLET BACK IN HIS
Trousers
ALOTTA
In Japan, men come first and women
Come second
AUSTIN
Or sometimes not at all
ALOTTA
Care for some saki?
AUSTIN
Sak-i it to me!
Alotta pours them saki.  Alotta unscrews the diamond in her
Ring.  A sign on the inside of her ring reads ""Relaxation
Pills.""  She drops two PILLS into his drink
Austin takes a sip.  His eyes glaze over.  He's instantly
Woozy
ALOTTA
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
AUSTIN
Mmmm...I feel extreme relaxation
A big BUBBLE comes to the surface, right in front of Austin
AUSTIN
(reciting poem)
'Pardon me for being rude, It was
Not me, it was my food
It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down
Below.'
ALOTTA
That's very clever.  Do you know any
Other poems?
AUSTIN
(reciting in a lofty
Tone)
'Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the corner fudge is made
Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
ALOTTA
(genuinely moved)
Thank you, that's beautiful.  To
Your health
AUSTIN
To my health
ALOTTA
Kiss me
They go to kiss.  She notices HIS TERRIBLE TEETH, CLOSE-UP
ALOTTA
Do you mind if I ask you a personal
Question?
AUSTIN
Is it about my teeth?
ALOTTA
Yes
AUSTIN
Damn.  What exactly do you do at
Virtucon?
ALOTTA
I'll tell you all in due time, after
We make love.  But first, tell me
Another poem
AUSTIN
I think it was Wordsworth who penned
This little gem:  'Press the button
Pull the chain, out comes a chocolate
Choo-choo train.'

Fine, have it your way.  Gentlemen
You have five days to come up with

Get away from my mother!

Don't worry, mother.  Lie down
Austin, you have a lot of explaining
To do
AUSTIN
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was
A man
BASIL EXPOSITION
Damn it, man!  You're talking about
My mother!
AUSTIN
You must admit, she is rather mannish
No offense, but if that's a woman
It looks like she's been beaten with
An ugly stick
VANESSA
Really, Austin!
AUSTIN
Look at her hands, baby!  Those are
Carpenter's hands
BASIL EXPOSITION
All right, Austin, I think you should
Go
AUSTIN
I think if everyone were honest
They'd confess that the lady looks
Exactly like a man in drag

I'm leaving!

Oh, and Austin?
AUSTIN
Yes, Basil?

Be careful
AUSTIN
Thanks
Basil escorts his mother out

Austin, may I have a word with you?
AUSTIN
Of course, luv
VANESSA
Listen, I know I'm just being
Neurotic, but I can't shake this
Suspicious
Feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina.  I mean, I
Don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad
Relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues
You went to her penthouse.  It makes me feel so small to
Give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this
Weird, irrational, unfocused...well, jealousy.  I'm sorry
AUSTIN
Don't be sorry.  You're right to be
Suspicious.  I shagged her.  I shagged
Her rotten
VANESSA
(stunned)
I can't believe you made love to her
Just like that.  Did you use
Protection?
AUSTIN
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter

No, did you use a condom?

I don't know.  I was thinking, maybe
I'd be a vet or something, cause I

Inconsequential
THERAPIST
That's not true, Doctor.  Please
Tell us about your childhood
GROUP
Yes, of course.  Go ahead, etc
DR. EVIL
Very well, where should I begin?  My
Father was a relentlessly self-
Improving boulangerie owner from
Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy
And a penchant for buggery.  My mother
Was a fifteen-year-old French
Prostitute named Chloe with webbed
Feet.  My father would womanize, he
Would drink, he would make outrageous
Claims, like he invented the question
Mark.  Sometimes he would accuse
Chestnuts of being lazy.  A sort of
General malaise that only the genius
Possess and the insane lament.  My
Childhood was typical
Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons.  In the spring we'd make
Meat helmets.  If I was insolent, I was placed in a burlap
Bag and beaten with reeds.  Pretty standard, really.  At the
Age of twelve I received my first scribe.  At the
Age of fifteen, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically
Shaved my testicles.  There really is nothing like a shawn
Scrotum.  At the age of eighteen, I went off to evil medical
School.  From there...

There they are!
Two SECURITY GUYS jump on either side of the steamroller
Vanessa wrestles the machine gun off on and pushes him away
Austin punches the other one off

Welcome to my underground lair, Mr

How lovely.  I believe your name is
Vanessa?  I'd shake your hands, except
For obvious reasons
VANESSA
I don't understand
DR. EVIL
My hand, dammit!  Look at it!
AUSTIN
What's wrong with your hand?
DR. EVIL
Don't try to suck up to me!  It's a
Little late for that.  I'm a freak!
Look at it, it's been rendered useless
He moves his arm around to show them, but it's virtually
Normal, just slightly aged

It won't just be active volcanoes
Inactive ones will erupt as well

Tectonic plates will shift, causing
Massive earthquakes.  Imagine no

Your day?

Speak French or whatever', and the
Other guy goes something in Paris
Talk, and I go 'um, just back off'
And he goes 'get out' and I go 'make
Me'

Contempt)
Fascinating.  What are your plans
For this evening?

Why are you feeding him?  Why don't
You just kill him?
DR. EVIL
In due time
SCOTT EVIL
But what if he escapes?  Why don't
You just shoot him?  What are you
Waiting for?
DR. EVIL
I have a better idea.  I'm going to
Put him in an easily-escapable
Situation involving an overly-
Elaborate and exotic death
SCOTT EVIL
Why don't you just shoot him now?
Here, I'll get a gun.  We'll just
Shoot him.  Bang!  Dead.  Done
DR. EVIL
One more peep out of you and you're
Grounded.  Let's begin
A PRIVATE ARMY SOLDIER grabs Austin and Vanessa.  Dr. Evil
Hits a button.  One whole wall slides out to reveal a tank
DR. EVIL
Mr. Powers, Vanessa, some friends of
Mine are joining us for dinner
They're quite delighted you'll be part of the meal
The soldier takes Austin and Vanessa to the tank and puts
Them in the dipping mechanism
AUSTIN
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them
To pay?
DR. EVIL
No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to
Die.  Even after they pay me the
Money, I'm still going to melt all
The cities of the world with hot
Magma
DR. EVIL
Release the sharks!Mr. Powers, all the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads.  I figure  every creature deserves a warm meal.
NUMBER TWO
(clearing his throat nervously)
Dr. Evil?
DR. EVIL
Yes, what is it?  You're interrupting my moment of triumph
NUMBER TWO
It's about the sharks.  Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List.  We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape
DR. EVIL
(disappointed)
You know, I have one simple request... and that is to have sharks... with fricking laser beams attached to their heads!
Evidently, my cycloptic colleague informs me... that that can't be done. Can you remind me what I pay you people for?
Honestly, throw me a bone here. What do we have?
NUMBER TWO
Sea bass.
DR. EVIL
Right.
NUMBER TWO
They're mutated sea bass.
DR. EVIL
Really?  Are they ill-tempered?
NUMBER TWO
Absolutely.
DR. EVIL
That's a start.
(to guard)
All right, guard, begin the Unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping
Mechanism.
The guard do so.  Austin and Vanessa begin to descend slowly
Towards the surface of the water
DR. EVIL
Close the tank!
SCOTT EVIL
Aren't you going to watch them?
They'll get away!
DR. EVIL
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
SCOTT EVIL
I have a gun in my room.  Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
DR. EVIL
No Scott.  You just don't get it, do you?
You don't.
It's no hassle.

INT.  TANK AREA
Austin and Vanessa slowly descend towards the water.  They
Can see the WATER BUBBLING beneath them, and a sea bass jumps by them.
VANESSA
What's your plan?
AUSTIN
First, I plan to soil myself... then I'm going to regroup and come up with a new plan. Any thoughts?
VANESSA
Wait a minute. I always have this with me, just in case.
She pulls out a container of dental floss.
AUSTIN
All right, I get it.  I have bad teeth.
VANESSA
No, Austin. The floss is to swing ourselves onto the ledge.
AUSTIN
All right. Hold on.
Austin takes the container and throws it to an upward pipe. It wraps around like a grappling hook.

AUSTIN
All right, toothpaste!
Vanessa places a tube of toothpaste in his hand.  Meanwhile
The guard is reaching to undo the floss.  Austin places the
Open tube on his palm, aimed at the guard.  Vanessa WHISTLES
At the guard loudly.  He turns around
AUSTIN
Judo chop!
Austin JUDO CHOPS the toothpaste tube, sending a stream of
Toothpaste into the guard's eyes
GUARD
(screaming, rubbing
His eyes)
My eyes!  My eyes!
Austin folds the tube across the top of the wire, grabbing
Both ends
AUSTIN
Hold on, Vanessa!
She grabs onto him and they slide down the floss to safety
Right as the dipping mechanism goes under the water
Meanwhile, the guard waits for them with toothpaste smeared
All over his face
He and Austin STRUGGLE
The guard manages to get Austin pinned to the ground, Austin's
Head dangling over the water.  SEA BASS circle.  The water boils, dangerously close to Austin's head.
VANESSA
(shouting)
Austin, watch out!
Austin FLIPS the guard over.  The SEA BASS chew the guard's head off like a blender.
AUSTIN
Not a good time to lose one's head.
VANESSA
Indeed.
AUSTIN
That's not the way to get ahead in life.
VANESSA
No
AUSTIN
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong. He'll never be the head of a major corporation.
VANESSA
OK, that will do.
AUSTIN
OK.

GUY 3
Well, you know he's a henchman for Dr. Evil.  Sometimes they work late. Can I just say something that may sound a little sappy?  I think it's such a testament to our friend John that
so many of his buddies showed up to honor him.  There's a lot of love in this room.
They cheer and clink their glasses.
A large-breasted WAITRESS approaches.

Decapitated by an ill-tempered mutated sea bass?

Yes. OK.
He hangs up and walks back to the table.
GUY 2
What's wrong?  Was that John?  Is he coming late?

John Smith is not coming

Things you stand for&emdash;
Free love, swinging,  parties  are all now, in the
Nineties, considered to   be...evil?
AUSTIN
No, man, what we swingers were
Rebelling against were uptight squares
Like you, whose bag was money and
World domination.  We were innocent
Man.  If we'd known the consequences
Of our sexual liberation, we would
Have done things differently, but
The spirit would have remained the
Same.  It's freedom, baby, yeah!
DR. EVIL
Face it, freedom failed
AUSTIN
No, man, freedom didn't fail. Right now, we've got freedom and responsibility. It's a very groovy time
DR. EVIL
There's nothing more pathetic
Than an aging hipster
AUSTIN
All right, baldy.Shut your cakehole. Come on. Let's go
Alotta enters.  She holds a gun to Vanessa's head
ALOTTA
Not so fast
DR. EVIL
Well, it seems the tables have turned
Mr. Powers
Alotta keeps pushing Vanessa into the room
VANESSA
Go ahead, Austin. Don't worry about me

Just then, Scott Evil enters
SCOTT EVIL
I can take my Sega, right, Dad?
Austin grabs Scott and puts the gun to his head
AUSTIN
It seems the tables have turned again
Dr. Evil
DR. EVIL
Not really.  Kill the little bastard
See what I care
SCOTT EVIL
Dad, we just made a breakthrough in
Group!
DR. EVIL
I had the group liquidated, you little
Shit.  They were insolent
SCOTT EVIL
I hate you!  I hate you!  I wish I
Was never artificially created in a
Lab
Scott breaks from Austin's grip and runs away
DR. EVIL
Scott, that hurts Daddy when you say that, honestly
Number Two enters with two briefcases, one of them with a Fembot inside
DR. EVIL
Number Two. Your timing is impeccable. Go ahead. Take Mr. Powers away
Number two drops one case, points his revolver at Dr. Evil
NUMBER TWO
No
DR. EVIL
What?
NUMBER TWO
Dr. Evil, I've spent turning this two-bit evil empire... into a world-class multinational. I was going to have a cover story in Forbes. But, you, like an idiot, wanted to take over the world...
And you don't realize there is no world anymore. It's only corporations
DR. EVIL
Silence, Number Two!
NUMBER TWO
No. I've had enough of you pushing me around
Number Two takes a chair
NUMBER TWO
Mr. Powers I have a business proposition you might find very interesting
As Austin is approaching...
DR. EVIL
All right. I've had enough
Dr. Evil presses the trapdoor chair button, Number Two falls into the fiery pit
Vanessa gives Alotta a judo chop
VANESSA
Judo chop!
Meanwhile, Dr. Evil runs towards a button in the wall
A timer reading 0:30 is seen
EASTERN EUROPEAN MAN (O.S.)
(on PA)
The complex will self-destruct
Dr. Evil runs to the egg shaped rocket. Austin SHOOTS and misses. The rocket closes (the words CRYOGENIC FREEZING BEGINNING are seen in  the doors) and begins to lift up through          A HOLE IN THE CEILING
AUSTIN
Let's split! Let's go! This place is going to blow!
Austin and Vanessa run out the door

Austin smiles as he takes the sherbert pot, and Vanessa drags him away

AUSTIN
Come on, baby! It's gonna blow! Let's go. Move it!
Austin and Vanessa run towards the Shaguar, some mooks running after them. Austin jumps doing cartwheels into the car... landing in a way his crotch hits the shift stick. Close-up as he groans in pain - and again, when he changes the transmission to first gear. The Shaguar drives away

A messy bedroom. Austin and Vanessa are eventually seen cuddling in bed
VANESSA
I love you, Mr. Powers
AUSTIN
And I love you, Mrs. Powers
His now clean teeth shine. Austin's communicator is heard
AUSTIN
That'll be Basil Exposition
VANESSA
Ignore it, Austin. Come back to bed
AUSTIN
Duty calls, baby
Austin grabs the Casio scheduler, brings it to a desk in front of the bed, and opens it - the thing conveniently covering Austin's privates. Basil's face is seen on the screen
BASIL EXPOSITION
Hello Austin.  I hope I'm not interrupting your honeymoon
Vanessa is stretching in the background. She lies down again
AUSTIN
No, not at all, Basil
BASIL EXPOSITION
Did you get that fruit basket I sent you?
Vanessa rises, holding two pineapples in front of her breasts
VANESSA
Yes, we did, Basil, but you sent too much. I'm gonna have to send some to my mother
Austin grabs something in front of him...

AUSTIN
Oh, Don't forget these
Austin hands two melons, which cover Vanessa's... you know
BASIL EXPOSITION
Did you get my other gift?
Vanessa rises, a rack of spice shakers in front of her chest
VANESSA
We did
AUSTIN
Yes, Basil, nice rack
Austin grabs something in the table... a painting of two naked breasts
AUSTIN
But who in the world gave us this drawing? It's bizarre
He lifts the painting in front of Vanessa. She puts it in front of her boobs, and stares
BASIL EXPOSITION
As you know, Dr. Evil has escaped in his rocket... which has disappeared from our tracking system
Vanessa, gift box in her chest, sits besides Austin

AUSTIN
Hold on. Coffee?
VANESSA
Yes, please
Austin runs away, covering his junk with the box
BASIL EXPOSITION
And, Vanessa, by the way, you have been made a full agent
VANESSA
That's fantastic, Basil! Thanks!
AUSTIN (O.S.)
Milk?
VANESSA
Yes, please
Austin, the coffee pot in front of his junk, turns the milk jugs in front of Vanessa's... you know, into the coffee cups
BASIL EXPOSITION
And, Austin, Her Majesty the Queen informs me... that you are to be knighted
AUSTIN
Very shagadelic!
Austin sits in the bed besides Vanessa
BASIL EXPOSITION
The best of luck to both of you!
AUSTIN
Thanks, Basil!
BASIL EXPOSITION
(waving)
Goodbye!
Screen turns off. Vanessa puts a balloon in her mouth
AUSTIN
You know, Vanessa... I'll never forget the first time I saw you
With ellipsis, Vanessa blows the balloon, which grows increasingly phallic in front of Austin's crotch
AUSTIN
You were so incredibly beautiful... so incredibly sexy... I knew I had to have you... right then and there.Did you feel the same way?
She takes the balloon off her mouth
VANESSA
Actually, I couldn't stop staring at your teeth
AUSTIN
Oh
Vanessa releases the balloon, which deflates
Knocking on door
AUSTIN
I ordered some champagne. Come in!

The waiter enters, we only see his feet as he pushes the cart.
VANESSA  (o.s.)
Lovely, Austin
AUSTIN (o.s.)
Right over there's fine. Thank you
Austin and Vanessa are now in bathrobes

VANESSA
Let's go out on the terrace. It's a beautiful night. We can look at the stars.
They kiss. The plate on the cart is opened... it's a shoe.

AUSTIN (o.s.)
Smashing idea, baby. Look at you
Eventually it closes on Random Task's face. He cricks his neck, Austin and Vanessa look. She gasps and runs.
VANESSA
Look out!
Random Task THROWS HIS SHOE
ANGLE ON SHOE SPINNING IN THE AIR
The shoe HITS AUSTIN IN THE HEAD.  Austin pauses.  The shoe  has not killed him.  It has just hurt him
AUSTIN
Ow!  That really hurt.  I'm going to
Have a lump there, you idiot!  Who
Throws a shoe?  You fight like a
Woman
Random Task starts approaching. Austin does a Karate Kid crane stance, and goes for him. It stops as he grabs his throat and starts strangling Austin, pushing him towards the wall.  Vanessa approaches with the 'Swedish-Made, Penis-Enlarger Pump'.
VANESSA
Austin!
She hands him the Pump.
AUSTIN (choking)
Honestly, it's not mine!
VANESSA
No,  use it
Austin attaches the pump to Random Task's crotch, he groans. Austin  pumps , making Random Task uncomfortable and eventually scream. Vanessa hits his over the head with a champagne bottle, and Random Task falls to the ground, smile on his face
Austin pushes Random Task down the hallway on the food cart he came in with (The pump still attached), with a large crash. A scream is heard. Austin slams the door behind him
AUSTIN
Smashing
Vanessa goes to the balcony, Austin follows. Both holding champagne glasses
AUSTIN
Look how beautiful the night sky is
VANESSA
Isn't that the Big Dipper?
AUSTIN
Yeah, and that looks just like Uranus. 
VANESSA
Austin...
VANESSA
I've never seen that big star before
AUSTIN
Yeah, what is that?
He stretches out a pocket telescope

It ran one step ahead
As we followed in the dance
Between the parted pages and were pressed
In love's hot fevered iron
Like a striped pair of pants

Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again
Oh, no!
I recall the yellow cotton dress
Foaming like a wave
On the ground around your knees
The birds like tender babies in your hands
And the old men playing checkers
By the trees

Someone left the cake out in the rain

'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again

There will be another song for me
For I will sing it
There will be another dream for me
Someone will bring it
I will drink the wine while it is warm
And never let you catch me
Looking at the sun
And after all the loves of my life
After all the loves of my life
You'll still be the one
I will take my life into my hands
And I will use it
I will win the worship in their eyes
And I will lose it
I will have the things that I desire
And my passion flow like rivers through the sky
And after all the loves of my life
Oh after all the loves in my life
I'll be thinking of you
And wondering why

A lot of pain a lot of triumph
Now I've come to the point where I'm happy

You could break me out the strait jacket
This hip-hop is just play action
I switch off and I keep smashing, I'm a legend, fuck the rap-off
They say I can't do my thing, I'ma build my own lane
You come in, you get ran over, but damn, you sober
I'm the god emcee like Hova
But I'm on another level and my grind is over
I’ll put the heat on your back like you're sitting in Rovers
And he always prayed to God I'm just bringing him closer
Feel like I'm doing a bid and my mind in Angola
You be food, then I'm cool, they tried to get over
I stopped picking up my phone, they won't get any closer
They watching my every step because I'm living in motion
Seen it in the hood, I can't, feeling is open
They ask for my money every other day
Like I'm asking for something
But when I had nothing they was laughing
They told me that I'd never make it rapping
It brings tears to see I'm on top, but I told you that I'd make it
14, I was living like my life was the pavement
And I wanted to die, couldn't nobody save me
Now I save my own self and I'm on and I'm famous
And I deal with the haters
Ain't nobody gonna take away what I built
Fuck the death threats, small impostors
But really got the love, but they just choosing that option
When I started to live better, they started to hate
I still got the same brain, that caught all the cases
I've still got the same eyes and seen all the places
But I ain't never been faking
And, it's not a game, it's not the Trail Blazers
Throwing shots but we dying
And the rap game, it's the slave trade
No time for meditation, turning into robots
The Devil is money, it's not even human
The people die for a piece of paper, it's so stupid
Man, live however you do it, I guarantee
You see your life as a child and make you at your all
Just make sure that you smile
But dying every day, ma's look at me now
There was hating, but I never stop, I wanted to drop
But BasedGod gave me strength in the Vans
I gotta really notice my chance, make history, man
Three back, I was feeling like ""damn!""
You don't know how I felt when I was washing my hands
Off that filth that was around, I'd never be down
One the streets I'm gone, I never be around
'Cause the hood is a lie
Man, you better wake up before you're dead or surprised
I'm just trying to save myself man
For real, but they trapped in the middle
Don't wanna go to school 'cause the teacher's too simple
I just wanna know where I come from
The truth, tell me, before I desolve
It's connected to the woods, the wilderness is my home
The world say I'm bad because of my color
But they don't get the fact that I say that I love you
People given the option to hustle
Just take it and, I swear to God if you're willing to struggle
And once you pass the bottom you gonna get to the top
It's a lot of hate up in the world, just make sure that you watch"

I done told my congressman and he said quote (dig this boy)
Sometimes, I wonder what I'm gonna do
But there ain't no cure
For the summertimes blues. Woah, there ain't no cure"

Ain't nothing like the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

I got your picture hangin' on the wall
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name
I realize it's just a picture in a frame

I read your letters when you're not here
But they don't move me and they don't groove me like when I hear
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear

Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

I play the game, of fantasy
I pretend but I know in reality
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me

No other sound is quite the same as your name
No touch can do half as much
: To make me feel better
: So let's stay together

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you phone, I'm well aware
Nothing can take your place of being there

So let me get the real thing
So let me get the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing"

No games, I came with a classic 30 like the mini Nintendo
Yeah, you catch a Klitschko, right into the big show
I lay down the law, when JC black out it ain't Jim Crow
I'm down ten toe, two guns, a Kimbo
30 shot, he duckin' a pole, stuck in limbo
Come get your shit smoked, semi will murk kinfolk
JC will stain the glass...in church windows
Now what's the popular vote? Ya throwin' rocks at the GOAT
Who traded yacht for a boat?
What's a lot to the most?
Wait? You violate I get him shot in the throat
So if you trip, he'll eat a clip like he swallowed a roach
Look, I bang mine from the waist line with no answers
I'm a straight timer you a programmer
I'm in the jets with the TECs by the clothes hamper
You buzzin' for talkin' out ya neck, that's throat cancer
Look, I rock for delph, big dawg of the common wealth
Head first in that dirt, how an ostrich felt
All I need is a lil' blade and a Glock for help
I got the knife 'n the toaster, I'm 'bout to shock myself!
Get the belt, who want a piece? Y'all gon' get it, one a piece
If him up he get hemmed up, cuffed and creased
You act hard on stage, you'se a fuckin' geek
I brought bars by the waves that's Muscle Beach
I'm a beast, this the prey, but squares think he got the sauce, in a fish filet
I wore that time like a man, not shit to say
I couldn't tell on Death Row like I was Michel'le
Now get your arms to the ceilin' when I lift the K
You rap for the cam', these bombs in the buildin'; Tim McVeigh
I duff your fiancee on Christmas Day
Fuck what he be on, say, (Beyonce) I carry twins for J(ay)
I say look, you in the way, shots ring, they gon' call a SWAT team
We keep a street sweeper to leave the block clean
Yeah that mop thing, stashed by the box spring
With the drum I lay him flat, pick a hot wing
I said he will not swing, he takin' it to the dome
There's paper that's on the phone got me breakin' another zone
I bury you in the yard, scrapin' you to the bone
In your driveway with the shovel like the neighbor from Home Alone
I'm grown, you just as funny as you look
You ain't never had to kick a door with a skully on your foot
Dirty AK, I'm goin' dummy on the jooks
I'm 'bout to make JPay, I got some money on the books
I said he shook, if it's war than you get a halo
Scorpion on the Kato
This D.E. 40 ain't in Vallejo
Twistin' Harry Potter my main hoe
Lay low with a Draco
Killer Instinct I'ma sender wherever J go (Jago)
Ayo, if I was in crowd I'd hit you wit a tomato
And it's grocery bags at every battle so don't get fuckin' crazy
You are not big enough for the body bag, you are just a baby
Look alive squirt

Absolutely nothin' bring me to you
But I still gotta kill you, easily too
Why?
Somethin' about this flow you just can't expose
I won't even make it close, they say gotta be pilled up to try to stop me
So on first take they poppin' Molly like they Jaylin Rose
I got an accurate shot
So strap up, like when cool niggas passin' the cops
Cause every gun got a name
And judgin' from this Gun Title ain't gon' be no ""after the shot""
It's these niggas that shit on battle rap the moment they ain't capable of showin' anything new
You know the niggas that battle rap but they not battle rappers cause the shit corny?
Yeah I know, it makes sense to me too
I didn't change the clip, I changed the gun, everything I'm dishin' new (additional)
We could be acres apart, they still gon' find a place in your heart, nigga they unconditional
These are not threats, ain't no need to talk about it
Shit he can't even see the rays bitch I'm ultraviolet
And bein' in front of this bus', shit not even Rosa Parks will try it
You're makin' history, shit I make niggas great when they go through the hoops, including you
I'm the only one of these niggas that actually give credit for losin' to
But you gotta fight, I mean many niggas have lost on this road, but only a few found it
Too many playin' the numbers game, worried about the view countin'
And who's countin', til they at they wake, and it ain't you countin'
I mean the shit is sad, I thought he took a break, you know flip a bag
But the fans don't even ask about him, I thought the shit was really sad
Though not really
It's still fans on them Norfolk streets, they just switched to Ave
And I know you sick of hearin' that, but you gotta clear it though
Take care of home, and when you do, break a leg, tear the bone; Derrick Rose
Cause at this point, you done and you can only get washed once like generic clothes
You in a brawl for your health, you gon' need all of they help
Cause you dealin' with hecklers, this gon' look like when Prep pausin' himself
Though I'm devilish, you-y'all remember me, spittin' crack like Snoop in a wheelchair?
You wanna know what else stem from that thought?
He chokin' and gettin' exposed tryin' to get rid of Raw
Same scenario, right?
But that scope got a lens wide enough to keep every nigga on yo' field watchin'
I send a paid shooter, he will pop
And you gon' only see him once like Will pops
I'm involved with the hammer next to me
I won't even let a nigga affect my sleep
He'll get that extra sleep, I even call it my rest in peace (restin' piece)
Nigga it's never safe, that weapon raised, mind, body and soul segregate
Blastin', the clips only compliment the ratchets so you gon' hate when you see 'em, they like weddin' tapes
I know what hood he go in cause that's the hood I stroll in
Need I remind you? That machine behind you ain't good promotion
They know when I'm stormin' just by how calm I approach
That fire work, like Jason Pierre Paul wit it though
Cause now I'm forever armed wit the fo'
It's body bags at every battle, make sure your homie found one
But do not-you know the rest nigga, let's go

I'm dope, sick, I think I need some boxin'
It's 'bout time for a rebuttal for them dreams you droppin'
You said I shit on battle rap? That's cause fiends is coppin'
But I ain't never shit on battle rap, that ain't even really True, like them jeans you rockin'
I'll ruin ya dude's life for them dead presidents
Get chewed you lose stripes, y'all wet peppermint
You got back on Smack and really set precidence
They gave you a legend, I heard you got to battle Chef Trez and shit
Damn, you killin' it man
Ever since he wasn't able to pay rent
He did a 100 battles and made a thousand dollars and eight cents
If y'all tryin' to get me on the card it take chips
Or get a one rounder out this fraud for baked fish
Cake mix, steak tips, a zip
He battles nobodies, shoot shots you can't miss
What I'm sayin' is, y'all rate him a great, it don't make sense
Just cause he Rap-A-Lot don't crown J Prince
Take this, exclusivity make your bread last
Fuck ya pen game, believability you dead last
What I'm cookin', even the trailer blowin' up that's a meth lab
ARP set the J up, this a chest pass
This as easy as a layup off the fresh glass
I'm Russian soldiers in the field like a Spetsnaz
I send his heart to the house of his bride, Fed Ex fast
But then his head, a couple hours behind like jet lag
Get dragged, I circle ya block, dome check him
I had to put in work on my ock with no weapon
If we was in the cell I'd beat him and phone check him
Knife in his ass, blood will have a shittier stream than NOME 7
I'm a road legend, cold flexin', state to state on ya
You gon' need a grenade launcher and some face armor
Find your location and lay on it then bang on ya
Gun with a bayonet, I put the Blade on it like a Daywalker
I hate all of the fake fraud and the raps they say to ya
I'll crack his head like a macadamia
Snap his trachea, it's too flooded in the ring, this shit Wrestlemania
I'm in a Rolls Royce whippin' a Ghost it's Castlevania
Video game bars, what's that? Nerd shit
Boy that ain't nothin' but truth
If I say somethin' 'bout 2K y'all gon' jump through the roof
Right? Right
Bunch of selective criticism all comin' from fruits
That hear Friday punchlines and cum on they boots
""Aw Craig shop somethin' somethin' head shot oooh my God""
I say look, I'm in VA sittin' low on a three day give and go
Where fiends tryin' to trade a dime of that sweet thing
For a key chain and a pee stained Vizio
All I got is gun bars cause I let my heat bang really though
Bunch of 40's in my crib, it's like the G Thang video
Here we go, ya flow? Give it 2 outta 10
Cause y'all get burnt by Smack, crawl back and let him screw y'all again
They tried to cut my hands off and I grew out a limb
I was never scared to burn a bridge cause I knew how to swim
And it's grocery bags at every battle so don't get fuckin' crazy
You are not big enough for the body bag, you a just a baby

That last round was a problem witchu
I gotta be honest witchu
It's them four bar set ups, four bars that are not official
You use the four bar set up for, ""upper cut 'em through the roof like it's Mortal Kombat""...fuckin' garbage
But aye, JC battled in garages, niggas love startin'
You was in them fuckin' garages too nigga, and you wasn't parkin'
See these niggas love showin' out on camera, only on set they thuggin', just extra buggin'
All that actin' gon' get your man bodied by the can, not the Oscar you was expectin' was it?
It's not like we've been rivals, but that pen title, I'll kill for it
Populated the Pearly Gates with speed  that keep the .38's on a spin cycle
And I'm still spittin' and the shots heat you
But like a hot single, you gotta deal wit it
So which team we servin'
The niggas that fill up they rap sheet braggin' 'bout they rap sheet
Armed robbery, wow, a thievin' person
Kick doors, you happy cause you got caught jackin', so did Pee Wee Herman
The shit don't even sound  but this shit different y'all
It can flip a car faster than a crowd riot
So I gotta hold it down and keep the crowd silent
Then the rounds flyin'
And fuck how you feel, I'm the first man sprayin'
""K"" and ""respect"" don't even go together, not even if Birdman say it
I don't have to ask him to stop, there's a whole society passin' for props
The automatics I got will make the bitch jump out faster than Kennedy car after the shot
I can guarantee my hood worse
At home K would've got found in a dumpster
Half the body hangin' out like one of Suge's shirts
Nigga he can be the first to get served
But that's if the bars don't murder him first
There's too much crack in this pad, every round I hustle, from the first to the third
And I am all with the shits
All that actin' belong with the clips
See they try to shoot like me but none of 'em accurate
It's like that government trackin', that shit all in the wrist
I know they could've taken the first shot to at least be remembered, but that shit all in the risk
I mean who gon' respect it?
I mean he too busy tryin' to convince y'all that he yo' complexion
Egghead nigga damn near got a yolk complexion
Back to battle rap, my habitat, where none of y'all can stop me
And everything after there's a carbon copy
Oh I own that, that chrome clap, what's on my side kick like my partner got me
We can make sure the casket's closed and he can take that act on the road
Cause only one person saw the body
Take care of them feelings first cause dealin' in feelings (fillings) hurts
Especially around us
You can end up losin' DNA and then you get this (dentist) work
Regardless if niggas feel me, can't no nigga kill me
I got a Gothic flow K, Guantanamo Bay, nigga the pen' is filthy
And I'm good with the pump
I can show y'all how a death stare really look when he slumped
I'm what's poppin' right now, them facades? Just hospital gowns
Soon as you check 'em, they all gotta put on a front
Now I know niggas don't wanna hear where Rich Dollaz at and that's cool
No disrespect to dude
But I'm the one who sent him there my nigga and he expectin' you
Round 2

I talk about your jeans, now I gotta talk about this shit
You lookin' real bummy for it
How your shirt got 20 dollars it and he ain't even pay $20 for it?
I touch down in NY, I got a quarter of sour
I hit the pedal and broke out like a poisonous flower
I got to the telly with ARP, he told JC, ""Meet the boys in an hour.""
You was upstairs in your room, puttin' toys in the shower
With that mini chest it's skinny pathetic, small physique
That says you need a booster step for your barber seat
Rappin', like you clappin' hand held monster heat
Nah, you need ya hand held 'cross the street
Because if J walkin', what he talkin', tell him talk to me
I've been the cause of grief for puttin' y'all to sleep
Throw me in the deep end, I'm killin' sharks to eat
You'll drown in the water...of Dawson's Creek
Peep, they ask me, ""Where you been?"" I don't like to blog
I'd rather smack you in your chin with a viking log
You micro soft I'm Zeus with lightening rod
I let you throw a punch and hit J(ay) with a Silent Bob
I say, ""Who's nice as dawg?"" You? He had to get a shot
Ain't no way he got the belt, all his jeans got elastic at the top
I done sold fake fish, had the tilapia to spot
Lost all the clientele, but I had to get the gwap
This shot, you roof will shatter
You small I send a deuce-deuce at ya
Put this pussy on a plate, I made a pupu platter
While you was playing Checkers, Connect 4, Life, Trouble, Candy Land, Chutes and Ladders
I had to check a connect for life, havin' trouble gettin' that can' to land, shootin' Ladders!
Gruesome matters, but I heard you had a son my brother, god bless, amazin' grace
I hope you raise him to be a man and not a waste of space
But just know the day gon' come where he try you, and break ya face
Judgin' by how you built, it'll be the age of eight
See it's hard to believe you lettin' sparks fly, dude wildin'
Not built like Smart Guy in 2000
I split ya melon with a banana make a fruit salad
Or throw you in the sleeper and snap my weight on your vocals like I knew Khalid
I'm too violent, free my dawg, pushin' through the courts
Cause the cops hit the door and put him through porch
The last spot got hot, we never knew the source
It had me in a hole, I had to leave over the pigs like Kalua pork
Luau's in Hawaii at a new resort
I don't expect you to catch that cause you dork
I be ridin' in limousines, the newest Porsche
You be survivin' on Kid Cuisines and usin' sporks
Be humble, or eat knuckle and scream ""uncle""
I ain't comin' here to son you, I came to Capri Sun you
You little weak piece of shit, you would die if a bee stung you
When you walk past the middle school they mean mug you
But let you tell it, you palm a chopper and let it blow
You ain't even as tall as a chopper from head to toe
Braggin' 'bout yo' pen game, that's some shit I will never know
That's like fans sayin', ""Yeah he lyin'. He's definitely lyin'...but the way he said it though...""
Let it go, I mix pain, dope and aggy
Why don't you take your pen game to the bowlin' alley
I served fiends with syringes on the floor, open baggies
They was fightin' over the pipe before North Dakota rallies
I said dope around me, I was thuggin' you wit the dick suckers
I almost lost a finger fuckin' wit the fence cutters
You was in Facebook chump groups, talkin' punches and your pen number
I was upstate, jump suit, punchin' in a pen number
And all these fans who say dude live and I hate you guys
Just know if the shoe fits, I bet it's grade school size
Because it is grocery bags at every battle
Now don't get fuckin' crazy
You are not big enough for a body bag, you are just a baby

Alright, picture this
Sike, this is exactly the round I go and kill
Never mind the time keepers, Bob Viola, dealer with holmes nigga you know the drills
He left stiff with a hole in him
Go get him! The shit open still
Of course he got rocked wit the beam
The first person shot on the scene like Cloverfield
I had to switch my whole style for this shit
So now I stalk the target when I aim the lead and I only aim for heads
Shit I be waitin' wit the Magnum like Mike under Stacey bed
Bitch I'm there til the job done
And job one? Slaughter one of his kids
And we ain't there til the body hit the river, I'm talkin' water under a bridge
And for real niggas, this shit easily felt
John Witherspoon on the Wayans how I reach for the belt
I just do it different
This for all the niggas who heard me rap and actually caught all the jewels I've givin'
For the niggas who heard punch with force and force yo' punch and actually knew the difference
For those who find that I reach, I'm just way outta they reach
In a league by myself
I mean you snap but you not allowed enough to let that demon be felt
I mean you slaughtered legends on King Of The Dot, so how come you ain't get a ring for the belt?
Ah nah, cause it's not a perk
See he put in work but that shit was seasonal help
Now which one of y'all thought I was gon' leave this bitch without a body
Just know, I believe in myself, that experience is out of body
But now I'm back to smoke somebody that wasn't on my radar at first
See how my attack got a lot of niggas mistaken
That means I got a method in schoolin' like How High
But so I'm diggin' old plots to get them Franklins
I'm talkin' big coffins, Sig sparkin', lead pourin' like Flint faucets
I'm the best period, I look deep in niggas souls, then I leave with niggas souls
Dealt a lot of pain with the kind of reign (Rain) not even Beasley can control
Heaven's waitin', then the nine get flashed
I tell 'em, ""Catch 'em in traffic"" but watch for the white man walkin'
See they know that's the sign you passed
The complexity of my rounds? It make them bitches a wreckin' ball
I know I may lose niggas sometimes but I stay in debt for y'all
I could easily drop Pokemon shit every round, but it ain't my message y'all
Just know, a lot of monsters come out of these rounds, you just gotta catch 'em all
One shot, I'm blastin', the gun shot collapsed him
They know it all til they run into me
Then they just end up unconscious rappers
Nigga I'm back snappin', of course I got the flow
Can't deny the flow, when I explode
You can't stop the fire with a flapjacket
They thought he was strapped for this schoolin' til he got sent back packin'
I need comp' you know, and even though the Glow, this Sho' Nuff gon' be the Last Dragon
So K, it is over wit
Overdose from the dopest pen, y'all know I wrote the shit
Every battle turns into a eulogy, my consolences"

Right between the sound machine
On a cloud of sound I drift in the night
Any place it goes is right
Goes far, flies near
To the stars away from here
Well, you don't know what we can find
Why don't you come with me little girl
On a magic carpet ride
Well, you don't know what we can see
Why don't you tell your dreams to me
Fantasy will set you free

Close your eyes girl
Look inside girl
Let the sound
Take you away
{Instrumental}
Last night I hold Aladdin's lamp
So I wished that I could stay
Before the thing could answer me
Well, someone came and took the lamp away
I looked around a lousy candle's all I found
Well, you don't know what we can find
Why don't you come with me little girl
On a magic carpet ride
Well, you don't know what we can see
Why don't you tell your dreams to me
Fantasy will set you free

Close your eyes girl
Look inside girl
Let the sound
Take you away
{Instrumental}
Well, you don't know what we can find
Why don't you come with me little girl
On a magic carpet ride....
Well, you don't know what we can find
Why don't you come with me little girl
On a magic carpet ride...."

Fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober?
Leave me alone
Let me go home
Let me go home and start over
Ramblin' around this dirty old town
Singin' for nickles and dimes
Times gettin' rough
I ain't got enough
To buy me a bottle of wine

When you gonna let me get sober?
Leave me alone
Let me go home
Let me go home and start over
A pain in my head
There's bugs in my bed
My pants are so old that they shine
Out on the street
I beg the people I meet
To buy me a bottle of wine

Haha! I suspected she was! Sink her! May they fire her for a barren ewe! So she says: Tay for thee? Well, I saith: Angst so mush: and desired she might not take it amiss if I esteemed her but an odd. If I did ate toughturf I’m not a mishy-missy. Of course I know, pettest, you’re so learningful and considerate in yourself, so friend of vegetables, you long cold cat you! Please by acquiester to meek my acquointance! Codling, snakelet, iciclist! My diaper has more life to it! Who drowned you in drears, man, or are you pillale with ink?

But hold hard till I’ve got my latchkey vote and I’ll teach him when to wear what woman callours. On account of the gloss of the gleison Hasaboobrawbees isabeaubel.

Cuddle, ye divil ye! It’s our toot-a-toot. Hearhere! Sensation! Let them, their whole four courtships! Let them, Bigbawl and his boosers’ eleven makes twelve territorials. The Old Sot’s Hole that wants wide streets to commission their noisense in, at the Mitchells v. Nicholls. Aves Selvae Acquae Valles! And my waiting twenty classbirds, sitting on their stiles!

But I’ll plant them a poser for their nomanclatter. When they’re out with the daynurse doing Chaperon Mall. Bright pigeons all over the whirrld will fly with my mistletoe message round their loveribboned necks and d crumb of my cake for each chasta dieva. We keeps all and sundry papers. In th’ amourlight, O my darling! No, I swear to you by Fibsburrow churchdome and Sainte Andr‚e’s Under-shift, by all I hold secret from my world and in my underworld of nighties and naughties and all the other wonderwearlds!

Whowham would have ears like ours, the blackhaired! Do you like that, silenzioso? Are you enjoying, this same little me, my life, my love? Why do you like my whisping? Is it not divinely deluscious? But in’t it bafforyou? Misi misi! Tell me till my thrillme comes! I will not break the seal. I am enjoying it still, I swear I am! Why do you prefer its in these dark nets, if why may ask, my sweetykins? Sh sh! Long-ears is flying. No, sweetissest, why would that ennoy me? But don’t! You want to be slap well slapped for that. Your delighted lips, love, be careful! Mind my duvetyne dress above all! It’s golded silvy, the newest sextones with princess effect. For Rut-land blue’s got out of passion. So, so, my precious! O, I can see the cost, chare! Don’t tell me! Why, the boy in sheeps’ lane knows that. If I sell whose, dears? Was I sold here’ tears? You mean those conversation lozenges? How awful! The bold shame of me! I wouldn’t, chickens, not for all the juliettes in the twinkly way! I could snap them when I see them winking at me in bed.

11. If you met on the binge a poor acheseyeld from Ailing, when the tune of his tremble shook shimmy on shin, while his countrary raged in the weak of his wailing, like a rugilant pugi-lant Lyon O’Lynn; if he maundered in misliness, plaining his plight or, played fox and lice, pricking and dropping hips teeth, or wringing his handcuffs for peace, the blind blighter, praying Dieuf and Domb Nostrums foh thomethinks to eath; if he weapt while he leapt and guffalled quith a quhimper, made cold blood a blue mundy and no bones without flech, taking kiss, kake or kick with a suck, sigh or simper, a diffle to larn and a dibble to lech; if the fain shinner pegged you to shave his immartial, wee skillmustered shoul with his ooh, hoodoodoo! brok — ing wind that to wiles, woemaid sin he was partial, we don’t think, Jones, we’d care to this evening, would you?
Answer: No, blank ye! So you think I have impulsivism? Did they tell you I am one of the fortysixths? And I suppose you heard I had a wag on my ears? And I suppose they told you too that my roll of life is not natural? But before proceeding to conclusively confute this begging question it would be far fitter for you, if you dare! to hasitate to consult with and consequentially attempt at my disposale of the same dime-cash problem elsewhere naturalistically of course, from the blinkpoint of so eminent a spatialist. From it you will here notice, Schott, upon my for the first remarking you that the sophology of Bitchson while driven as under by a purely dime-dime urge is not without his cashcash characktericksticks, borrowed for its nonce ends from the fiery goodmother Miss Fortune (who the lost time we had the pleasure we have had our little recherch‚ brush with, what, Schott?) and as I further could have told you as brisk as your D.B.C. beha-viouristically paillet‚ with a coat of homoid icing which is in reality only a done by chance ridiculisation of the whoo-whoo and where’s hairs theorics of Winestain. To put it all the more plumbsily. The speechform is a mere sorrogate. Whilst the qua-lity and tality (I shall explex what you ought to mean by this with its proper when and where and why and how in the subsequent sentence) are alternativomentally harrogate and arrogate, as the gates may be.
Talis is a word often abused by many passims (I am working out a quantum theory about it for it is really most tantumising state of affairs). A pessim may frequent you to say: Have you been seeing much of Talis and Talis those times? optimately meaning: Will you put up at hree of irish? Or a ladyeater may perhaps have casualised as you temptoed her … la sourdine: Of your plates? Is Talis de Talis, the swordswallower, who is on at the Craterium the same Talis von Talis, the penscrusher, no funk you! who runs his duly mile? Or this is a perhaps cleaner example. At a recent postvortex piece infustigation of a determinised case of chronic spinosis an extension lecturer on The Ague who out of matter of form was trying his seesers, Dr’s Het Ubeleeft, borrowed the question: Why’s which Suchman’s talis qualis? to whom, as a fatter of macht, Dr Gedankje of Stoutgirth, who was wiping his whistle, toarsely retoarted: While thou beast’ one zoom of a whorl! (Talis and Talis originally mean the same thing, hit it’s: Qualis.)
Professor Loewy–Brueller (though as I shall promptly prove his whole account of the Sennacherib as distinct from the Shal-manesir sanitational reforms and of the Mr Skekels and Dr Hydes problem in the same connection differs toto coelo from the fruit of my own investigations — though the reason I went to Jericho must remain for certain reasons a political secret — especially as I shall shortly be wanted in Cavantry, I congratulate myself, for the same and other reasons — as being again hope-lessly vitiated by what I have now resolved to call the dime and cash diamond fallacy) in his talked off confession which recently met with such a leonine uproar on its escape after its confinement Why am I not born like a Gentileman and why am I now so speak-able about my own eatables (Feigenbaumblatt and Father, Juda — pest, 5688, A.M.) whole-heartedly takes off his gabbercoat and wig, honest draughty fellow, in his public interest, to make us see how though, as he says: ‘by Allswill’ the inception and the descent and the endswell of Man is temporarily wrapped in ob-scenity, looking through at these accidents with the faroscope of television, (this nightlife instrument needs still some subtrac-tional betterment in the readjustment of the more refrangible angles to the squeals of his hypothesis on the outer tin sides), I can easily believe heartily in my own most spacious immensity as my ownhouse and microbemost cosm when I am reassured by ratio that the cube of my volumes is to the surfaces of their sub-jects as the sphericity of these globes (I am very pressing for a parliamentary motion this term which, under my guidance, would establish the deleteriousness of decorousness in the morbidis-ation of the modern mandaboutwoman type) is to the fera — city of Fairynelly’s vacuum.

As my explanations here are probably above your understand-ings, lattlebrattons, though as augmentatively uncomparisoned as Cadwan, Cadwallon and Cadwalloner, I shall revert to a more expletive method which I frequently use when I have to sermo with muddlecrass pupils. Imagine for my purpose that you are a squad of urchins, snifflynosed, goslingnecked, clothyheaded, tangled in your lacings, tingled in your pants, etsitaraw etcicero. And you, Bruno Nowlan, take your tongue out of your inkpot! As none of you knows javanese I will give all my easyfree trans-lation of the old fabulist’s parable. Allaboy Minor, take your head out of your satchel! Audi, Joe Peters! Exaudi facts!
The Mookse and The Gripes.
Gentes and laitymen, fullstoppers and semicolonials, hybreds and lubberds!
Eins within a space and a wearywide space it wast ere wohned a Mookse. The onesomeness wast alltolonely, archunsitslike, broady oval, and a Mookse he would a walking go (My hood! cries Antony Romeo), so one grandsumer evening, after a great morning and his good supper of gammon and spittish, having flabelled his eyes, pilleoled his nostrils, vacticanated his ears and palliumed his throats, he put on his impermeable, seized his impugnable, harped on his crown and stepped out of his immobile De Rure Albo (socolled becauld it was chalkfull of masterplasters and had borgeously letout gardens strown with cascadas, pinta-costecas, horthoducts and currycombs) and set off from Luds — town a spasso to see how badness was badness in the weirdest of all pensible ways.
As he set off with his father’s sword, his lancia spezzata, he was girded on, and with that between his legs and his tarkeels, our once in only Bragspear, he clanked, to my clinking, from veetoes to threetop, every inch of an immortal.
He had not walked over a pentiadpair of parsecs from his azylium when at the turning of the Shinshone Lanteran near Saint Bowery’s-without-his-Walls he came (secunding to the one one oneth of the propecies, Amnis Limina Permanent) upon the most unconsciously boggylooking stream he ever locked his eyes with. Out of the colliens it took a rise by daubing itself Ni-non. It looked little and it smelt of brown and it thought in nar — rows and it talked showshallow. And as it rinn it dribbled like any lively purliteasy: My, my, my! Me and me! Little down dream don’t I love thee!
And, I declare, what was there on the yonder bank of the stream that would be a river, parched on a limb of the olum, bolt downright, but the Gripes? And no doubt he was fit to be dried for why had he not been having the juice of his times?
His pips had been neatly all drowned on him; his polps were charging odours every older minute; he was quickly for getting the dresser’s desdaign on the flyleaf of his frons; and he was quietly for giving the bailiff’s distrain on to the bulkside of his cul de Pompe. In all his specious heavings, as be lived by Opti-mus Maximus, the Mookse had never seen his Dubville brooder — on-low so nigh to a pickle.
Adrian (that was the Mookse now’s assumptinome) stuccstill phiz-…-phiz to the Gripes in an accessit of aurignacian. But All-mookse must to Moodend much as Allrouts, austereways or wastersways, in roaming run through Room. Hic sor a stone, singularly illud, and on hoc stone Seter satt huc sate which it filled quite poposterously and by acclammitation to its fullest justotoryum and whereopum with his unfallable encyclicling upom his alloilable, diupetriark of the wouest, and the athemyst-sprinkled pederect he always walked with, Deusdedit, cheek by jowel with his frisherman’s blague? Bellua Triumphanes, his everyway addedto wallat’s collectium, for yea longer he lieved yea broader he betaught of it, the fetter, the summe and the haul it cost, he looked the first and last micahlike laicness of Quartus the Fifth and Quintus the Sixth and Sixtus the Seventh giving allnight sitting to Lio the Faultyfindth.
— Good appetite us, sir Mookse! How do you do it? cheeped the Gripes in a wherry whiggy maudelenian woice and the jack- asses all within bawl laughed and brayed for his intentions for they knew their sly toad lowry now. I am rarumominum blessed to see you, my dear mouster. Will you not perhopes tell me everything if you are pleased, sanity? All about aulne and lithial and allsall allinall about awn and liseias? Ney?
Think of it! O miserendissimest retempter! A Gripes!
— Rats! bullowed the Mookse most telesphorously, the concionator, and the sissymusses and the zozzymusses in their ro — benhauses quailed to hear his tardeynois at all for you cannot wake a silken nouse out of a hoarse oar. Blast yourself and your anathomy infairioriboos! No, hang you for an animal rurale! I am superbly in my supremest poncif! Abase you, baldyqueens! Gather behind me, satraps! Rots!
— I am till infinity obliged with you, bowed the Gripes, his whine having gone to his palpruy head. I am still always having a wish on all my extremities. By the watch, what is the time, pace?
Figure it! The pining peever! To a Mookse!
— Ask my index, mund my achilles, swell my obolum, wosh-up my nase serene, answered the Mookse, rapidly by turning clement, urban, eugenious and celestian in the formose of good grogory humours. Quote awhore? That is quite about what I came on my missions with my intentions laudibiliter to settle with you, barbarousse. Let thor be orlog. Let Pauline be Irene. Let you be Beeton. And let me be Los Angeles. Now measure your length. Now estimate my capacity. Well, sour? Is this space of our couple of hours too dimensional for you, temporiser? Will you give you up? Como? Fuert it?
Sancta Patientia! You should have heard the voice that an-swered him! Culla vosellina.
— I was just thinkling upon that, swees Mooksey, but, for all the rime on my raisins, if I connow make my submission, I can-nos give you up, the Gripes whimpered from nethermost of his wanhope. Ishallassoboundbewilsothoutoosezit. My tumble, lou-dy bullocker, is my own. My velicity is too fit in one stockend. And my spetial inexshellsis the belowing things ab ove. But I will never be abler to tell Your Honoriousness (here he near lost his limb) though my corked father was bott a pseudowaiter, whose o’cloak you ware.
Incredible! Well, hear the inevitable.

My building space in lyonine city is always to let to leonlike Men, the Mookse in a most consistorous allocution pompifically with immediate jurisdiction constantinently concludded (what a crammer for the shape-wrucked Gripes!). And I regret to proclaim that it is out of my temporal to help you from being killed by inchies, (what a thrust!), as we first met each other newwhere so airly. (Poor little sowsieved subsquashed Gripes! I begin to feel contemption for him!).

Elevating, to give peint to his blick, his jewelled pederect to the allmysty cielung, he luckystruck blueild out of a few should-be santillants, a cloister of starabouts over Maples, a lucciolys in Teresa street and a stopsign before Sophy Barratt’s, he gaddered togodder the odds docence of his vellumes, gresk, letton and russicruxian, onto the lapse of his prolegs, into umfullth one-scuppered, and sat about his widerproof He proved it well who — onearth dry and drysick times, and vremiament, tu cesses, to the extinction of Niklaus altogether (Niklaus Alopysius having been the once Gripes’s popwilled nimbum) by Neuclidius and In-exagoras and Mumfsen and Thumpsem, by Orasmus and by Amenius, by Anacletus the Jew and by Malachy the Augurer and by the Cappon’s collection and after that, with Cheekee’s gela-tine and Alldaybrandy’s formolon, he reproved it ehrltogether when not in that order sundering in some different order, alter three thirty and a hundred times by the binomial dioram and the penic walls and the ind, the Inklespill legends and the rure, the rule of the hoop and the blessons of expedience and the jus, the jugicants of Pontius Pilax and all the mummyscrips in Sick Bokes’ Juncroom and the Chapters for the Cunning of the Chap-ters of the Conning Fox by Tail.
While that Mooksius with preprocession and with propre-cession, duplicitly and diplussedly, was promulgating ipsofacts and sadcontras this raskolly Gripos he had allbust seceded in monophysicking his illsobordunates. But asawfulas he had caught his base semenoyous sarchnaktiers to combuccinate upon the silipses of his aspillouts and the acheporeoozers of his haggy-own pneumax to synerethetise with the breadchestviousness of his sweeatovular ducose sofarfully the loggerthuds of his sakel-laries were fond at variance with the synodals of his somepooliom and his babskissed nepogreasymost got the hoof from his philio-quus.

Nuvoletta in her lightdress, spunn of sisteen shimmers, was looking down on them, leaning over the bannistars and listening all she childishly could. How she was brightened when Should-rups in his glaubering hochskied his welkinstuck and how she was overclused when Kneesknobs on his zwivvel was makeacting such a paulse of himshelp! She was alone. All her nubied companions were asleeping with the squirrels. Their mivver, Mrs Moonan, was off in the Fuerst quarter scrubbing the back-steps of Number 28. Fuvver, that Skand, he was up in Norwood’s sokaparlour, eating oceans of Voking’s Blemish. Nuvoletta lis-tened as she reflected herself, though the heavenly one with his constellatria and his emanations stood between, and she tried all she tried to make the Mookse look up at her (but he was fore too adiaptotously farseeing) and to make the Gripes hear how coy she could be (though he was much too schystimatically auricular about his ens to heed her) but it was all mild’s vapour moist. Not even her feignt reflection, Nuvoluccia, could they toke their gnoses off for their minds with intrepifide fate and bungless curiasity, were conclaved with Heliogobbleus and Commodus and Enobarbarus and whatever the coordinal dickens they did as their damprauch of papyrs and buchstubs said. As if that was their spiration! As if theirs could duiparate her queendim! As if she would be third perty to search on search proceedings! She tried all the winsome wonsome ways her four winds had taught her. She tossed her sfumastelliacinous hair like le princesse de la Petite Bretagne and she rounded her mignons arms like Mrs Cornwallis–West and she smiled over herself like the beauty of the image of the pose of the daughter of the queen of the Em-perour of Irelande and she sighed after herself as were she born to bride with Tristis Tristior Tristissimus. But, sweet madonine, she might fair as well have carried her daisy’s worth to Florida. For the Mookse, a dogmad Accanite, were not amoosed and the Gripes, a dubliboused Catalick, wis pinefully obliviscent.
I see, she sighed. There are menner.
The siss of the whisp of the sigh of the softzing at the stir of the ver grose O arundo of a long one in midias reeds: and shades began to glidder along the banks, greepsing, greepsing, duusk unto duusk, and it was as glooming as gloaming could be in the waste of all peacable worlds. Metamnisia was allsoonome coloro-form brune; citherior spiane an eaulande, innemorous and un numerose. The Mookse had a sound eyes right but he could not all hear. The Gripes had light ears left yet he could but ill see. He ceased. And he ceased, tung and trit, and it was neversoever so dusk of both of them. But still Moo thought on the deeps of the undths he would profoundth come the morrokse and still Gri feeled of the scripes he would escipe if by grice he had luck enoupes.
Oh, how it was duusk! From Vallee Maraia to Grasyaplaina, dormimust echo! Ah dew! Ah dew! It was so duusk that the tears of night began to fall, first by ones and twos, then by threes and fours, at last by fives and sixes of sevens, for the tired ones were wecking, as we weep now with them. O! O! O! Par la pluie!
Then there came down to the thither bank a woman of no appearance (I believe she was a Black with chills at her feet) and she gathered up his hoariness the Mookse motamourfully where he was spread and carried him away to her invisible dwelling, thats hights, Aquila Rapax, for he was the holy sacred solem and poshup spit of her boshop’s apron. So you see the Mookse he had reason as I knew and you knew and he knew all along. And there came down to the hither bank a woman to all important (though they say that she was comely, spite the cold in her heed) and, for he was as like it as blow it to a hawker’s hank, she plucked down the Gripes, torn panicky autotone, in angeu from his limb and cariad away its beotitubes with her to her unseen shieling, it is, De Rore Coeli. And so the poor Gripes got wrong; for that is always how a Gripes is, always was and always will.be. And it was never so thoughtful of either of them. And there were left now an only elmtree and but a stone. Polled with pietrous, Sierre but saule. O! Yes! And Nuvoletta, a lass.
Then Nuvoletta reflected for the last time in her little long life and she made up all her myriads of drifting minds in one. She cancelled all her engauzements. She climbed over the bannistars; she gave a childy cloudy cry: Nu‚e! Nu‚e! A lightdress fluttered. She was gone. And into the river that had been a stream (for a thousand of tears had gone eon her and come on her and she was stout and struck on dancing and her muddied name was Missis-liffi) there fell a tear, a singult tear, the loveliest of all tears (I mean for those crylove fables fans who are ‘keen’ on the pretty-pretty commonface sort of thing you meet by hopeharrods) for it was a leaptear. But the river tripped on her by and by, lapping as though her heart was brook: Why, why, why! Weh, O weh I’se so silly to be flowing but I no canna stay!
No applause, please! Bast! The romescot nattleshaker will go round your circulation in diu dursus.

As I have now successfully explained to you my own natural-born rations which are even in excise of my vaultybrain insure me that I am a mouth’s more deserving case by genius. I feel in symbathos for my ever devoted friend and halfaloafonwashed, Gnaccus Gnoccovitch. Darling gem! Darling smallfox! Horose-shoew! I could love that man like my own ambo for being so baileycliaver though he’s a nawful curillass and I must slav to methodiousness.

My heeders will recoil with a great leisure how at the out-break before trespassing on the space question where even michelangelines have fooled to dread I proved to mindself as to your sotisfiction how his abject all through (the quickquid of Pro-fessor Ciondolone’s too frequently hypothecated Bettlermensch) is nothing so much more than a mere cashdime however genteel he may want ours, if we please (I am speaking to us in the second person), for to this graded intellecktuals dime is cash and the cash system (you must not be allowed to forget that this is all contained, I mean the system, in the dogmarks of origen on spurios) means that I cannot now have or nothave a piece of cheeps in your pocket at the same time and with the same man-ners as you can now nothalf or half the cheek apiece I’ve in mind unless Burrus and Caseous have not or not have seemaultaneous-ly sysentangled themselves, selldear to soldthere, once in the dairy days of buy and buy.
Burrus, let us like to imagine, is a genuine prime, the real choice, full of natural greace, the mildest of milkstoffs yet unbeaten as a risicide and, of course, obsoletely unadulterous whereat Caseous is obversely the revise of him and in fact not an ideal choose by any meals, though the betterman of the two is meltingly addicted to the more casual side of the arrivaliste case and, let me say it at once, as zealous over him as is passably he. The seemsame home and histry seeks and hidepence which we used to be reading for our prepurgatory, hot, Schott? till Duddy shut the shopper op and Mutti, poor Mutti! brought us our poor suppy, (ah who! eh how!) in Acetius and Oleosus and Sellius Volatilis and Petrus Papricus! Our Old Party quite united round the Slatbowel at Commons: Pfarrer Salamoss himself and that sprog of a Pedersill and his Sprig of Thyme and a dozen of the Murphybuds and a score and more of the hot young Capels and Lettucia in her greensleeves and you too and me three, twinsome bibs but hansome ates, like shakespill and eggs! But there’s many a split pretext bowl and jowl; and (snob screwing that cork, Schott!) to understand this as well as you can, feeling how back-ward you are in your down-to-the-ground benches, I have com — pleted the following arrangement for the coarse use of stools and if I don’t make away with you I’m beyond Caesar outnullused
The older sisars (Tyrants, regicide is too good for you!) be-come unbeurrable from age, (the compositor of the farce of dustiny however makes a thunpledrum mistake by letting off this pienofarte effect as his furst act as that is where the juke comes in) having been sort-of-nineknived and chewly removed (this soldier — author — batman for all his commontoryism is just another of those souftsiezed bubbles who never quite got the sandhurst out of his eyes so that the champaign he draws for us is as flop as a plankrieg) the twinfreer types are billed to make their reupprearance as the knew kneck and knife knickknots on the deserted champ de bouteilles. (A most cursery reading into the Persic–Uraliens hostery shows us how Fonnumagula picked up that propper numen out of a colluction of prifixes though to the permienting cannasure the Coucousien oafsprung of this sun of a kuk is as sattin as there’s a tub in Tobolosk) Ostiak della Vogul Marina!

Why the case is as inessive and impossive as kezom hands! Their inter-locative is conprovocative just as every hazzy hates to having a hazbane in her noze. Caseous may bethink himself a thought of a caviller but Burrus has the reachly roundered head that goes best with thofthinking defensive fideism. He has the lac of wis-dom under every dent in his lofter while the other follow’s onni vesy milky indeedmymy. Laughing over the linnuts and weeping off the uniun. He hisn’t the hey og he lisn’t the lug, poohoo. And each night sim misses mand he winks he had the semagen. It was aptly and corrigidly stated (and, it is royally needless for one ex ungue Leonem to say by whom) that his seeingscraft was that clarety as were the wholeborough of Poutres-bourg to be averlaunched over him pitchbatch he could still make out with his augstritch the green moat in Ireland’s Eye. Let me sell you the fulltroth of Burrus when he wore a younker. Here it is, and chorming too, in six by sevens! A cleanly line, by the gods! A king off duty and a jaw for ever! And what a cheery ripe outlook, good help me Deus v Deus! If I were to speak my ohole mouthful to arinam about it you should call me the ormuzd aliment in your midst of faime. Eat ye up, heat ye up! sings the somun in the salm. Butyrum et mel comedet ut sciat reprobare malum et eligere bonum. This, of course, also explains why we were taught to play in the childhood: Der Haensli ist ern Butterbrot, mein Butterbrot! Und Koebi iss dein Schtinkenkot! Ja! Ja! Ja!
This in fact, just to show you, is Caseous, the brutherscutch or puir tyron: a hole or two, the highstinks aforefelt and anygo prigging wurms. Cheesugh! you complain. And Hi Hi High must say you are not Hoa Hoa Hoally in the wrong!
Thus we cannot escape our likes and mislikes, exiles or am-busheers, beggar and neighbour and — this is where the dime — show advertisers advance the temporal relief plea — let us be tolerant of antipathies. Nex quovis burro num fit mercaseus? I am not hereby giving my final endorsement to the learned ignorants of the Cusanus philosophism in which old Nicholas pegs it down that the smarter the spin of the top the sounder the span of the buttom (what the worthy old auberginiste ought to have meant was: the more stolidly immobile in space appears to me the bottom which is presented to use in time by the top primo-mobilisk &c.). And I shall be misunderstord if understood to give an unconditional sinequam to the heroicised furibouts of the Nolanus theory, or, at any rate, of that substrate of apart from hissheory where the Theophil swoors that on principial he was the pointing start of his odiose by comparison and that whiles eggs will fall cheapened all over the walled the Bure will be dear on the Brie.
Now, while I am not out now to be taken up as unintention-ally recommending the Silkebjorg tyrondynamon machine for the more economical helixtrolysis of these amboadipates until I can find space to look into it myself a little more closely first I shall go on with my decisions after having shown to you in good time how both products of our social stomach (the excellent Dr Burroman, I noticed by the way from his emended food theory, has been carefully digesting the very wholesome criticism I helped him to in my princeps edition which is all so munch to the cud) are mutuearly polarised the incompatabilily of any delusional acting as ambivalent to the fixation of his pivotism. Positing, as above, too males pooles, the one the pictor of the other and the omber the Skotia of the one, and looking want-ingly around our undistributed middle between males we feel we must waistfully woent a female to focus and on this stage there pleasantly appears the cowrymaid M. whom we shall often meet below who introduces herself upon us at some precise hour which we shall again agree to call absolute zero or the babbling pumpt of platinism. And so like that former son of a kish who went up and out to found his farmer’s ashes we come down home gently on our own turnedabout asses to meet Margareen.
We now romp through a period of pure lyricism of shame-bred music (technologically, let me say, the appetising entry of this subject on a fool chest of vialds is plumply pudding the carp before doevre hors) evidenced by such words in distress as I cream for thee, Sweet Margareen, and the more hopeful O Mar-gareena! O Margareena! Still in the bowl is left a lump of gold! (Correspondents, by the way, will keep on asking me what is the correct garnish to serve drisheens with. Tansy Sauce. Enough). The pawnbreaking pathos of the first of these shoddy pieces reveals it as a Caseous effort. Burrus’s bit is often used for a toast. Criniculture can tell us very precisely indeed how and why this particular streak of yellow silver first appeared on (not in) the bowel, that is to see, the human head, bald, black, bronze, brown, brindled, betteraved or blanchemanged where it might be use-fully compared with an earwig on a fullbottom. I am offering this to Signorina Cuticura and I intend to take it up and bring it under the nosetice of Herr Harlene by way of diverting his attentions. Of course the unskilled singer continues to pervert our wiser ears by subordinating the space-element, that is to sing, the aria, to the time-factor, which ought to be killed, ill tempor. I should advise any unborn singer who may still be among my heeders to forget her temporal diaphragm at home (the best thing that could happen to it!) and attack the roulade with a swift colpo di glottide to the lug (though Maace I will insist was reclined from overdoing this, his recovery often being slow) and then, O! on the third dead beat, O! to cluse her eyes and aiopen her oath and see what spice I may send her. How? Cease thee, cantatrickee! I fain would be solo. Arouse thee, my valour! And save for e’er my true Bdur!
I shall have a word to say in a few yards about the acoustic and orchidectural management of the tonehall but, as ours is a vivarious where one plant’s breaf is a lunger planner’s byscent and you may not care for argon, it will be very convenient for me for the emolument to pursue Burrus and Caseous for a rung or two up their isocelating biangle. Every admirer has seen my goulache of Marge (she is so like the sister, you don’t know, and they both dress A L I K E!) which I titled The Very Picture of a Needlesswoman which in the presence ornates our national cruetstand. This genre of portraiture of changes of mind in order to be truly torse should evoke the bush soul of females so I am leaving it to the experienced victim to complete the general suggestion by the mental addition of a wallopy bound or, should the zulugical zealot prefer it, a congorool teal. The hatboxes which composed Rhomba, lady Trabezond (Marge in her ex-celsis), also comprised the climactogram up which B and C may fondly be imagined ascending and are suggestive of gentlemen’s spring modes, these modes carrying us back to the superimposed claylayers of eocene and pleastoseen formation and the gradual morphological changes in our body politic which Professor Ebahi–Ahuri of Philadespoinis (Ill) — whose bluebutterbust I have just given his coupe de grass to — neatly names a boŒte … surprises. The boxes, if I may break the subject gently, are worth about fourpence pourbox but I am inventing a more patent pro-cess, foolproof and pryperfect (I should like to ask that Shedlock Homes person who is out for removing the roofs of our criminal classics by what deductio ad domunum he hopes de tacto to detect anything unless he happens of himself, movibile tectu, to have a slade off) after which they can be reduced to a fragment of their true crust by even the youngest of Margees if she will take plase to be seated and smile if I please.
Now there can be no question about it either that I having done as much, have quite got the size of that demilitery young female (we will continue to call her Marge) whose types may be met with in any public garden, wearing a very “dressy” affair, known as an “ethel” of instep length and with a real fur, reduced to 3/9, and muffin cap to tone (they are “angelskin” this fall), ostentatiously hemming apologetically over the shirtness of some “sweet” garment, when she is not sitting on all the free benches avidously reading about “it” but ovidently on the look out for “him” or so “thrilled” about the best dressed dolly pram and beautiful elbow competition or at the movies swallowing sobs and blowing bixed mixcuits over “childe” chaplain’s “latest” or on the verge of the gutter with some bobbedhair brieffrocked babyma’s toddler (the Smythe–Smythes now keep TWO domes-tics and aspire to THREE male ones, a shover, a butlegger and a sectary) held hostage at armslength, teaching His Infant Majesty how to make waters worse.
(I am closely watching Master Pules, as I have regions to sus-pect from my post that her “litde man” is a secondary school — teacher under the boards of education, a voted disciple of Infan — tulus who is being utilised thus publicly by the seducente infanta to conceal her own more mascular personality by flaunting frivolish finery over men’s inside clothes, for the femininny of that totamulier will always lack the musculink of a verumvirum. My solotions for the proper parturience of matres and the edu-cation of micturious mites must stand over from the moment till I tackle this tickler hussy for occupying my uttentions.)
Margareena she’s very fond of Burrus but, alick and alack! she velly fond of chee. (The important influence exercised on everything by this eastasian import has not been till now fully flavoured though we can comfortably taste it in this case. I shall come back for a little more say farther on.) A cleopatrician in her own right she at once complicates the position while Burrus and Caseous are contending for her misstery by implicating her- self with an elusive Antonius, a wop who would appear to hug a personal interest in refined chees of all chades at the same time as he wags an antomine art of being rude like the boor. This Antonius–Burrus-Caseous grouptriad may be said to equate the qualis equivalent with the older socalled talis on talis one just as quantly as in the hyperchemical economantarchy the tan-tum ergons irruminate the quantum urge so that eggs is to whey as whay is to zeed like your golfchild’s abe boob caddy. And this is why any simple philadolphus of a fool you like to dress, an athemisthued lowtownian, exlegged phatrisight, may be awfully green to one side of him and fruitfully blue on the other which will not screen him however from appealing to my gropesarching eyes, through the strongholes of my acropoll, as a boosted blasted bleating blatant bloaten blasphorus blesphorous idiot who kennot tail a bomb from a painapple when he steals one and wannot psing his psalmen with the cong in our gregational pompoms with the canting crew.

(And, taking off soutstuffs and alkalike matters, I hope we can kill time to reach the salt because there’s some forceglass neutric assets bittering in the soldpewter for you to plump your pottage in). The thundering legion has stormed Olymp that it end. Twelve tabular times till now have I edicted it. Merus Genius to Careous Caseous! Moriture, te salutat!

That mon that hoth no moses in his sole nor is not awed by conquists of word’s law, who never with humself was fed and leaves his soil to lave his head, when his hope’s in his highlows from whisking his woe, if he came to my preach, a proud pursebroken ranger, when the heavens were welling the spite of their spout, to beg for a bite in our bark Noisdanger, would meself and Mac Jeffet, four-inhand, foot him out? — ay! — were he my own breastbrother, my doubled withd love and my singlebiassed hate, were we bread by the same fire and signed with the same salt, had we tapped from the same master and robbed the same till, were we tucked in the one bed and bit by the one flea, homo-gallant and hemycapnoise, bum and dingo, jack by churl, though it broke my heart to pray it, still I’d fear I’d hate to say!

Obsessed with the war time that get you to listen

Spreading fear through the nets what it's really all about

Some say that I'm blind but don’t look at the motors behind
Your at work well that’s cool with me but nobody is the change that they want to see
Are you really awake
Really controlling your fate
Walking round trying to carry this weight
Pointing out my mistake
Cause I ain't living like you but give a fuck son I’m living like I like to why

They say do this but they say grow to be so wise or so clueless

And there was more kinds of animals than you've ever seen
They'd run around free while the earth was being born
But the loveliest of them all was the Unicorn
There were green alligators and long necked geese
Some humpty-back camels and some chimpanzees
Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born
The loveliest of all was the Unicorn
Now God seen some sinning and it gave Him pain
And He says ""Stand back, I'm going to make it rain.""
He says ""Hey brother Noah, I'll tell you what to do
Build me a floating zoo. And take some of them...
Green alligators and long necked geese
Some humpty-back camels and some chimpanzees
Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born
Don't you forget My Unicorn.""
Old Noah was there to answer the call
He finished up making the ark just as the rain started fallin
He marched in the animals two by two
And he called out as they went through, ""Hey Lord, I got your...""
Green alligators and long necked geese
Some humpy-back camels and some chimpanzees
Some cats and rats and elephants, but Lord I'm so forlorn
I just can't see no Unicorn.""
Then Noah looked out through the driving rain
Them Unicorns were hiding, playing silly games
Kicking and splashing while the rain was pouring
Oh them silly Unicorns
There were green alligators and long necked geese
Some humpy-back camels and some chimpanzees
Noah cried ""Close the door, cause the rain is pouring
And we just can't wait for no Unicorn.""
The ark started movin, it drifted with the tide
Them Unicorns looked up from the rocks and they cried
And the waters came down and sort of floated them away
And that's why you'll never seen a Unicorn... to this very day
You'll see green alligators and long necked geese
Some humpy-back camels and some chimpanzees
Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born
You're never gonna see no Unicorn"

And it was plain to see

With my arms open wide
I threw away my pride
I'll sacrifice for you
Dedicate my life to you
I will go where you lead
Always there in time of need

And when I lose my will
You'll be there to push me up the hill

There's no, no looking back for us
We got love sure 'nough, that's enough

Stand by you like a tree, dare anybody to try and move me

Strength where I was torn down
Don't know what's in store but together we can open any door
Just to do what's good for you and inspire you a little higher

I know you can make a man out of a soul that didn't have a goal

Cause we, we got the right foundation and with love and determination
You're all, you're all I want to strive for and do a little more

Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!
Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!

Some people say we've got a lot of malice
Some say it's a lot of nerve
But I say we won't quit moving until we get what we deserve
We have been 'buked and we have been scorned
We've been treated bad, talked about as sure as you're born
But just as sure as it takes two eyes to make a pair, ha
Brother we can't quit until we get our share

Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!
Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!

I worked on jobs with my feet and my hands
But all the work I did was for the other man

And working for someone else

Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!

We'd rather die on our feet
Than be living on our knees

Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!
Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!

All right now, good God
You know we can do the boogaloo
Now we can say with the funky talk, and we do
Sometimes we sing and we talk
You know we jump back and do the camel walk

We're going to roam pretty far afield from country music, but stay with me on this; it's an amazing range of music to find packed into just one state. As they say in New Orleans, ""En ce qui concerne les gens , la nourriture et la musique , la variété est le piment de la vie."" (When it comes to people, food and music, variety is the spice of life."") So ""laissez le bon ton roulet"". (Let the good times roll.)

Songs About Louisiana
One of the oldest songs about the state is ""Lakes of Pontchartrain"", a folk song from around the time of the War of 1812. Not nearly so old, but a song that tells a story from Louisiana's early statehood is Johnny Horton's ""Battle of New Orleans"". Perhaps the most famous song associated with the state is by two-time Governor of Louisiana, Jimmie Davis, who wrote and recorded ""You Are My Sunshine"", one of the official state songs.
Other famous songs about the state include Randy Newman's ""Louisiana 1927"", Leon Russell's ""Jambalaya (on the Bayou)"", although old-timers prefer the Hank Williams Sr. version, Hank Williams Jr's ""Cajun Baby"", Mel McDaniel's ""Louisiana Saturday Night"", and Doug Kershaw's ""Calling Baton Rouge"".
Some of the most famous rock songs about Louisiana are from Creedence Clearwater Revival. While the band isn't from Louisiana, they sure sounded like it. Two that fit this collection are ""Proud Mary"" and ""Born on the Bayou"". The Animals' version of the traditional folk song, ""House of the Rising Sun"" is certainly well known. Lucinda Williams' ""Cresent City"" and Sonny Landreth's ""Back to Bayaou Teche"" may be less well known, but are equally good, as is this  version of ""Lady Marmalada"" by Christina Auguilera, Pink, Lil' Kim and Mya.
Songs About New Orleans
Starting with songs that celebrate Mardi Gras, Dr. John's ""Goin' Back to New Orleans"", the Preservation Hall Jazz Band's  ""Tootie Ma"", a brass band version of Jelly Roll Morton's ""New Orleans Blues"", Fats Domino's ""The Fat Man"" and Louis Armstrong's ""When the Saints Go Marching In"" will give you a taste of what New Orleans jazz is all about. But the list gets even more eclectic. Fats Domino does it in R&B with ""Walkin' to New Orleans"", and Them does it in blues with the Big Joe Williams' song, ""Baby, Please Don't Go"". Finally, Sonny Landreth sums-up the spirit of New Orleans with ""Levee Town"".
Hurricane Katrina and it's aftermath exposed the terrible response of FEMA and the true politics of the Bush Administration. Those attitudes get skewered in Bruce Springsteen's cover of ""How Can a Poor Man Stand such Times and Live?"", Bob Dylan's variation on the Memphis Minnie song ""The Levee's Gonna Break"" and Steve Earle's ""This City"".
Country Music
Country Music in Louisiana is heavily influenced by Cajun and blues music. It's played on the fiddle, guitar and other string instruments, and like it's influencers, It's bold and expressive.  Representative of the Louisiana Country sound is Lucinda Williams' ""Louisiana Man"", Jerry Reed's ""Amos Moses"", Sammy Kershaw's ""Third Rate Romance"", George Strait's ""Adalida"", Mary Chapin Carpenter's ""Down at the Twist and Shout"", and Black Water Bride's ""Over You"".
Creole Music
The Creole fiddle arrived in South Louisiana in the 17th century, coming ashore with French-speaking Africans from Saint-Domingue. The performance of Creole fiddle takes a lot of its cues from the African banjo.  The 1950s brought Zydeco to the forefront, with its big accordion sound, eclipsing Creole music. But Creole lives on in the homes and small clubs of Louisiana, and some argue it's a better representation of its original than present day Zydeco. Some great Creole music can be heard in
Cedric Watson's ""La Vieille Chanson De Mardi Gras"" and in the legendary Canray Fontenot's ""Les Barres De La Prison"".
Zydeco Music
Zydeco developed in southwest Louisiana by French Creole speakers, and blends blues with R&B. Gid Tanner and the Skillet Lickers were the first to have their music recorded in 1929 with ""It Ain't Gonna Rain No Mo"".  Zydeco is sometimes described as polka music, but that's really just the accordion. If you listen closely, what you'll hear is the blues. Performances rely on the back beat, with modern bands adding a double-kick bass drum to emphasize the syncopation. The accordion almost always plays some blues licks, and the guitars echo that. Listen to Boozoo Chavis hit a groove with ""Uncle Bud"", and Clifton Chenier sing ""Tu Le Ton Son Ton"" and  ""Ay Tete Fee"".
Cajun Music
Cajun music is one of the oldest forms of music in Louisiana. The French people who settled in Acadia, Nova Scotia, brought with them the music rooted in medieval France.  After their expulsion by the British in 1755, many of them migrated to southern Louisiana. There, these ""Acadians"" encountered and intermarried with other ethnic groups, fostering their evolution into ""the Cajuns"".  By the late 19th century, they adopted the accordion into their music. While it fell out of favor for a while in in the first half of the 20th century, it came back in 1964 when Dewey Balfa performed at the Newport Folk festival. Cajun music has enjoyed growing popularity since then, and is represented by Doug Kersahaw, with ""Louisiana Man"", Dewey Balfa with ""Jai Ete Au Bal"", and the Lost Bayou Ramblers with ""Blue Moon Special"". But no discussion of Cajun would fail to mention ""Jole Blon"". It's practically the Cajun national anthem. The version here is by Waylon Jennings.
New Orleans Jazz
New Orleans Jazz is itself an amalgamation of styles that come from a long musical tradition in New Orleans. You'll find an excellent presentation of it's history right here. For now, give a listen to Louis Armstrong playing ""Sweet Georgia Brown"", the Preservation Hall Jazz Band perform a version of  ""Tailgate Ramble"", John Boutte sing ""Foot of Canal Street"",  and Nina Simone sing ""Little Liza Jane"".
New Orleans Blues
One of the oldest is the traditional ""St. James Infirmary Blues"", but the New Orleans blues style didn't really get started until after WW2.  It's influenced by New Orleans jazz and Caribbean music, and it's generally upbeat with a faster tempo than swamp blues. You'll find examples in Professor Longhair's ""Walk Your Blues Away"", Johnny Copeland's ""Devil's Hand"" and Dr. John's ""I'm Gonna Go Fishing"".
Swamp Blues
Evolving from the delta blues, swamp blues developed first in  Baton Rouge during the 1950s. It uses a slower tempo and is influenced by cajun music. It's recognizable in songs like
Creedence Clearwater Revival's ""Suzie Q"", Tina Turner's ""Bayou Song"", Lazy Lester's ""I'm a Man"", Lucinda Williams' ""Can't Let Go"" and Tony Joe White's ""Polk Salad Annie"".
Swamp Rock
Some people claim that swamp rock begins and ends with CCR, but you'll find examples in The Meters' ""Fire on the Bayou"", Little Feat's ""Hamburger Midnight"", as well as CCR's ""Run Through the Jungle"".

How long it's going to last
And I haven't got time to do no studies
Once I get out of class
Telling you I'm just a fellow
Said I got a one track mind
And when it comes to thinking about anything but my baby
I just don't have any time

Too busy thinking about my baby
And I haven't got time for nothing else

The diamonds and pearls in the world
Could never match her worth, no no
She's some kind of wonderful, people tell you
I got heaven right here on earth
I'm just a fellow
With a one, one track mind
And when it comes to thinking about anything but my baby

Too busy thinking about my baby

To believe they never would

And it don't seem so lonely
We fill it up with only two
And when I hurt
Hurtin' runs off my shoulders
How can I hurt when holdin' you

If man is still alive
If woman can survive
They may find-

In the year 3535
Ain't gonna need to tell the truth, tell no lies
Everything you think, do, and say
Is in the pill you took today

In the year 4545
Ain't gonna need your teeth, won't need your eyes
You won't find a thing to chew
Nobody's gonna look at you

In the year 5555
Your arms are hanging limp at your sides
Your legs got nothing to do
Some machine's doing that for you

In the year 6565
Ain't gonna need no husband, won't need no wife
You'll pick your sons, pick your daughters too
From the bottom of a long glass tube
Whoa-oh-oh

In the year 7510
If God's a-coming, he ought to make it by then
Maybe he'll look around himself and say
“Guess it's time for the judgement day!”

In the year 8510
God is gonna shake his mighty head
He'll either say, “I'm pleased, where man has been”
Or tear it down and start again
Whoa-oh-oh

In the year 9595
I'm kinda wonderin', if man is gonna be alive
He's taken everything this old Earth can give
And he ain't put back nothing
Whoa-oh-oh

Now it's been ten thousand years
Man has cried a billion tears
For what he never knew
Now man's reign is through
But through the eternal night
The twinkling of starlight
So very far away
Maybe it's only yesterday

If woman can survive

A child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day

Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way

Well the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto

And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight
In the ghetto

Then one night in desperation
A young man breaks away
He buys a gun, He steals a car
Tries to run, but he don't get far
And his mama cries

As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto

And as her young man dies
On a cold and gray Chicago morning
Another little baby child is born

That I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man who gave me that awful name

Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me ""Sue.""

Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said: ""My name is 'Sue!' How do you do!
Now you're going to die!!""

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer

I tell you, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

And he said: ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong

He said: ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But ya ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
Because I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue

I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
And I called him my pa, and he called me his son
And I came away with a different point of view
And I think about him, now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him
Bill or George! Anything but Sue! I still hate that name!"

Baby baby here's why
Because love is here standin' by

All you've gotta do is dry your eyes long enough to see
That you have got the love you thought you had in him here in me
Love is hope girl love is strength
Here's someone standin' right beside ya
Who would go to any length to give you love true and deep
And hope you realize at last you found a love that you can keep
And only losers weep
So baby baby don't cry oh baby don't you cry now
Baby baby don't cry oh baby let me tell you why now
Baby baby here's why don't you know that
Love is here standin' by
I say love is here standin' by
Your tears are shed in vain I said

I look at Company Hill again, all sort of worn down and round. A long time ago it was real craggy, and stood like an island in the Teays River. It took over a million years to make that smooth little hill, and I've looked all over it for trilobites. I think how it has always been there and always will be, least for as long as it matters. The air is smoky with summertime. A bunch of starlings swim over me. I was born in this country and I have never very much wanted to leave. I remember Pop's dead eyes looking at me. They were real dry, and that took something out of me. I shut the door, head for the café.
I see a concrete patch in the street. It's shaped like Florida, and I recollect what I wrote in Ginny's yearbook: ""We will live on mangoes and love."" And she up and left without me—two years she's been down there without me. She sends me postcards with alligator wrestlers and flamingos on the front. She never asks me any questions. I feel like a real fool for what I wrote, and go into the café.
The place is empty, and I rest in the cooled air. Tinker Reilly's little sister pours my coffee. She has good hips. They are kind of like Ginny's and they slope nice curves to her legs. Hips and legs like that climb steps into airplanes. She goes to the counter end and scoffs down the rest of her sundae. I smile at her, but she's jailbait. Jailbait and black snakes are two things I won't touch with a window pole. One time I used an old black snake for a bullwhip, snapped the sucker's head off, and Pop beat hell out of me with it. I think how Pop could make me pretty mad sometimes. I grin.
I think about last night when Ginny called. Her old man drove her down from the airport in Charleston. She was already bored. Can we get together? Sure. Maybe do some brew? Sure. Same old Colly. Same old Ginny. She talked through her beak. I wanted to tell her Pop had died, and Mom was on the warpath to sell the farm, but Ginny was talking through her beak. It gave me the creeps.
Just like the cups give me the creeps. I look at the cups hanging on pegs by the storefront. They're decal-named and covered with grease and dust. There's four of them, and one is Pop's, but that isn't what gives me the creeps. The cleanest one is Jim's. It's clean because he still uses it, but it hangs there with the rest. Through the window, I can see him crossing the street. His joints are cemented with arthritis. I think of how long it'll be before I croak, but Jim is old, and it gives me the creeps to see his cup hanging up there. I go to the door to help him in.
He says, ""Tell the truth, now,"" and his old paw pinches my arm.
I say, ""Can't do her."" I help him to his stool.
I pull this globby rock from my pocket, and slap it on the counter in front of Jim. He turns it with his drawn hand, examines it. ""Gastropod,"" he says. ""Probably Permian. You buy again."" I can't win with him. He knows them all.
""I still can't find a trilobite,"" I say.
""There are a few,"" he says. ""Not many. Most of the outcrops around here are too late for them.""
The girl brings Jim's coffee in his cup, and we watch her pump back to the kitchen. Good hips.
""You see that?"" He jerks his head toward her.
I say, ""Moundsville Molasses."" I can spot jailbait by a mile.
""Hell, girl's age never stopped your dad and me in Michigan.""
""Tell the truth.""
""Sure. You got to time it so you nail the first freight out when your pants are up.""
I look at the windowsill. It is speckled with the crisp skeletons of flies. ""Why'd you and Pop leave Michigan?""
The crinkles around Jim's eyes go slack. He says, ""The war,"" and sips his coffee.
I say, ""He never made it back there.""
""Me either—always wanted to—there or Germany—just to look around.""
""Yeah, he promised to show me where you all buried that silverware and stuff during the war.""
He says, ""On the Elbe. Probably plowed up by now.""
My eye socket reflects in my coffee, steam curls around my face, and I feel a headache coming on. I look up to ask Tinker's sister for an aspirin, but she is giggling in the kitchen.
""That's where he got that wound,"" Jim says. ""Got it on the Elbe. He was out a long time. Cold, Jesus, it was cold. I had him for dead, but he came to. Says, 'I been all over the world'; says, 'China's so pretty, Jim.'""
""Dreaming?""
""I don't know. I quit worrying about that stuff years ago.""
Tinker's sister comes up with her coffeepot to make us for a tip. I ask her for an aspirin, and see she's got a pimple on her collarbone. I don't remember seeing pictures of China. I watch little sister's hips.
""Trent still wanting your place for that housing project?""
""Sure,"" I say. ""Mom'll probably sell it, too. I can't run the place like Pop did. Cane looks bad as hell."" I drain off my cup. I'm tired of talking about the farm. ""Going out with Ginny tonight,"" I say.
""Give her that for me,"" he says. He takes a poke at my whang. I don't like it when he talks about her like that. He sees I don't like it, and his grin slips. ""Found a lot of gas for her old man. One hell of a guy before his wife pulled out.""
I wheel on my stool, clap his weak old shoulder. l thnk of Pop, and try to joke. ""You stink so bad the undertaker's following you.""
He laughs. ""You were the ugliest baby ever born, you know that?""
I grin, and start out the door. I can hear him shout to little sister: ""Come on over here, honey, I got a joke for you.""
The sky has a film. Its heat burns through the salt on my skin, draws it tight. I start the truck, drive west along the highway built on the dry bed of the Teays. There's wide bottoms, and the hills on either side have yellowy billows the sun can't burn off. I pass an iron sign put up by the WPA: ""Surveyed by George Washington, the Teays River Pike."" I see fields and cattle where buildings stand, picture them from some long-off time.
I turn off the main road to our house. Clouds make the sunshine blink light and dark in the yard. I look again at the spot of ground where Pop fell. He had lain spread-eagled in the thick grass after a sliver of metal from his old wound passed to his brain. I remember thinking how beaten his face looked with prints in it from the grass.
I reach the high barn, and start my tractor, then drive to the knob at the end of our land and stop. I sit there, smoke, look again at the cane. The rows curve tight, but around them is a sort of scar of clay, and the leaves have a purplish blight. I don't wonder about the blight. I know the cane is too far gone to worry about the blight. Far off, somebody chops wood, and the ax-bites echo back to me. The hillsides are baked here and have heat-ghosts. Our cattle move to the wind gap, and birds hide in caps of trees where we never cut the timber for pasture. I look at the wrinkly old boundary post. Pop set it when the hobo and soldier days were over. It is a locust-tree post, and will be there a long time. A few dead morning glories cling to it.
""I'm just not no good at it,"" I say. ""It just don't do to work your ass off at something you're not no good at.""
The chopping stops. I listen to the beat of grasshopper wings, and strain to spot blight on the far side of the bottoms.
I say, ""Yessir, Colly, you couldn't grow pole beans in a pile of horseshit.""
I squash my cigarette against the floor plate. I don't want a fire. I press the starter, and bump around the fields, then down to the ford of the drying creek, and up the other side. Turkles fall from logs into stagnant pools. I stop my machine. The cane here is just as bad. I rub a sunburn into the back of my neck.
I say, ""Shot to hell, Gin. Can't do nothing right.""
I lean back, try to forget these fields and flanking hills. A long time before me or these tools, the Teays flowed here. I can almost feel the cold waters and the tickling the trilobites make when they crawl. All the water from the old mountains flowed west. But the land lifted. I have only the bottoms and stone animals I collect. I blink and breathe. My father is a khaki cloud in the canebrakes, and Ginny is no more to me than the bitter smell in the blackberry briers up on the ridge.
I take up my sack and gaff for a turkle. Some quick chubs flash under the bank. In the moss-dapples, I see rings spread where a turkle ducked under. This sucker is mine. The pool smells like rot, and the sun is a hardish brown.
I wade in. He goes for the roots of a log. I shove around, and feel my gaff twitch. This is a smart turkle, but still a sucker. I bet he could pull liver off a hook for the rest of his days, but he is a sucker for the roots that hold him while I work my gaff. I pull him up, and see he is a snapper. He's got his stubby neck curved round, biting at the gaff. I lay him on the sand, and take out Pop's knife. I step on the shell, and press hard. That fat neck gets skinny quick, and sticks way out. A little blood oozes from the gaff wound into the grit, but when I slice, a puddle forms.
A voice says, ""Get a dragon, Colly?""
I shiver a little, and look up. It's only the loansman standing on the creekbank in his tan suit. His face is splotched pink, and the sun is turning his glasses black.
""I crave them now and again,"" I say. I go on slitting gristle, skinning back the shell.
""Aw, your daddy loved turtle meat,"" the guy says.
I listen to scratching cane leaves in the late sun. I dump the tripes into the pool, bag the rest, and head up the ford. I say, ""What can I do for you?""
This guy starts up: ""I saw you from the road—just came down to see about my offer."" ""I told you yesterday, Mr. Trent. It ain't mine to sell."" I tone it down. I don't want hard feelings. ""You got to talk to Mom.""
Blood drips from the poke to the dust. It makes dark paste. Trent pockets his hands, looks over the cane. A cloud blocks the sun, and my crop glows greenish in the shade.
""This is about the last real farm left around here,"" Trent says.
""Blight'll get what the dry left,"" I say. I shift the sack to my free hand. I see I'm giving in. I'm letting this guy go and push me around.
""How's your mother getting along?"" he says. I see no eyes behind his smoky glasses.
""Pretty good,"" I say. ""She's wanting to move to Akron."" I swing the sack a little toward Ohio, and spray some blood on Trent's pants. ""Sorry,"" I say.
""It'll come out,"" he says, but I hope not. I grin and watch the turkle's mouth gape on the sand. ""Well, why Akron?"" he says. ""Family there?""
I nod. ""Hers,"" I say ""She'll take you up on the offer."" This hot shadow saps me, and my voice is a whisper. I throw the sack to the floor plate, climb up to grind the starter. I feel better in a way I've never known. The hot metal seat burns through my jeans.
""Saw Ginny at the post office,"" this guy shouts. ""She sure is a pretty.""
I wave, almost smile, as I gear to lumber up the dirt road. I pass Trent's dusty Lincoln, move away from my bitten cane. It can go now; the stale seed, the	drought, the blight—it can go when she signs the papers. I know I will always be to blame, but it can't just be my fault. ""What about you?"" I say. ""Your side hurt all that morning, but you wouldn't see no doctor. Nosir, you had to see that your dumb boy got the crop put proper in the ground."" I shut my trap to keep from talking like a fool.
I stop my tractor on the terraced road to the barn, and look back across the cane to the creekbed. Yesterday, Trent said the bottoms would be filled with dirt. That will put the houses above flood, but it'll raise the flood line. Under all those houses, my turkles will turn to stone. Our Herefords make rusty patches on the hill. I see Pop's grave, and wonder if the new high waters will get over it.
I watch the cattle play. A rain must be coming. A rain is always coming when cattle play. Sometimes they play for snow, but mostly it is rain. After Pop whipped the daylights out of me with that black snake, he hung it on a fence. But it didn't rain. The cattle weren't playing, and it didn't rain, but I kept my mouth shut. The snake was bad enough, I didn't want the belt too.
I look a long time at that hill. My first time with Ginny was in the tree-cap of that hill. I think of how close we could be then, and maybe even now, I don't know. I'd like to go with Ginny, fluff her hair in any other field. But I can see her in the post office. I bet she was sending postcards to some guy in Florida.
I drive on to the barn, stop under the shed. I wipe sweat from my face with my sleeve, and see how the seams have slipped from my shoulders. If I sit rigid, I can fill them again. The turkle is moving in the sack, and it gives me the creeps to hear his shell clinking against the gaff. I take the poke to the spigot to clean the game. Pop always liked turkle in a mulligan. He talked a lot about mulligan and the jungles just an hour before I found him.
I wonder what it will be like when Ginny comes by. I hope she's not talking through her beak. Maybe she'll take me to her house this time. If her momma had been anybody but Pop's cousin, her old man would let me go to her house. Screw him. But I can talk to Ginny. I wonder if she remembers the plans we made for the farm. And we wanted kids. She always nagged about a peacock. I will get her one.
I smile as I dump the sack into the rusty sink, but the barn smell—the hay, the cattle, the gasoline—it reminds me. Me and Pop built this barn. I look at every nail with the same dull pain.
I clean the meat, and lay it out on a piece of cloth torn from an old bed sheet. I fold the corners, walk to the house.
The air is hot, but it sort of churns, and the set screens in the kitchen window rattle. From inside, I can hear Mom and Trent talking on the front porch, and I leave the window up. It is the same come-on he gave me yesterday, and I bet Mom is eating it up. She probably thinks about tea parties with her cousins in Akron. She never listens to what anybody says. She just says all right to anything anybody but me or Pop ever said. She even voted for Hoover before they got married. I throw the turkle meat into a skillet, get a beer. Trent softens her up with me; I prick my ears.
""I would wager on Colly's agreement,"" he says. I can still hear a hill twang in his voice.
""I told him Sam'd put him on at Goodrich,"" she says. ""They'd teach him a trade.""
""And there are a good many young people in Akron. You know he'd be happier."" I think how his voice sounds like a damn TV. ""Well, he's awful good to keep me company. Don't go out none since Ginny took off to that college.""
I lean against the sink, rub my hands across my face. The smell of turkie has soaked between my fingers. It's the same smell as the pools.
Through the door to the living room, I see the rock case Pop built for me. The white labels show up behind the dark gloss of glass. Ginny helped me find over half of those. If I did study in a college, I could come back and take Jim's place at the gas wells. I like to hold little stones that lived so long ago. But geology doesn't mean lick to me. I can't even find a trilobite.
I stir the meat, listen for noise or talk on the porch, but there is none. I look out. A lightning flash peels shadows from the yard, and leaves a dark strip under the eave of the barn. I feel a scum on my skin in the still air. I take my supper to the porch.
I look down the valley to where bison used to graze before the first rails were put down. Now those rails are covered with a highway, and cars rush back and forth in the wind. I watch Trent's car back out, heading east into town. I'm afraid to ask right off if he got what he wanted.
I stick my plate under Mom's nose, but she waves it off. I sit in Pop's old rocker, watch the storm come. Dust devils puff around on the berm, and maple sprigs land in the yard with their white bellies up. Across the road, our windbreak bends, rows of cedars furling every which way at once.
""Coming a big one?"" I say.
Mom says nothing and fans herself with the funeral home fan. The wind layers her hair, but she keeps that cardboard picture of Jesus bobbing like crazy. Her face changes. I know what she thinks. She thinks how she isn't the girl in the picture on the mantel. She isn't standing with Pop's garrison cap cocked on her head.
""I wish you'd of come out while he's here,"" she says. She stares across the road to the windbreak.
""I heard him yesterday,"" I say.
""It ain't that at all,"" she says, and I watch her brow come down a little. ""It's like when Jim called us askin' if we wanted some beans an' I had to tell him to leave 'em in the truck at church. I swan how folks talk when men come 'round a widow.""
I know Jim talks like a dumb old fart, but it isn't like he'd rape her or anything. I don't want to argue with her. ""Well,"" I say, ""who owns this place?""
""We still do. Don't have to sign nothin' till tomorrow.""
She quits bobbing Jesus to look at me. She starts up: ""You'll like Akron. Law, I bet Marcy's youngest girl'd love to meet you. She's a regular rock hound too. 'Sides, your father always said we'd move there when you got big enough to run the farm.""
I know she has to say it. I just keep my mouth shut. The rain comes, ringing the roof tin. I watch the high wind snap branches from the trees. Pale splinters of light shoot down behind the far hills. We are just brushed by this storm.
inny's sports car hisses east on the road, honking as it passes, but I know she will be back.
""Just like her momma,"" Mom says, ""racin' the devil for the beer joints.""
""She never knew her momma,"" I say. I set my plate on the floor. I'm glad Ginny thought to honk.
""What if I's to run off with some foreman from the wells?""
""You wouldn't do that, Mom.""
""That's right,"" she says, and watches the cars roll by. ""Shot her in Chicago. Shot hisself too.""
I look beyond the hills and time. There is red hair clouding the pillow, blood-splattered by the slug. Another body lies rumpled and warm at the bed foot.
""Folks said he done it cause she wouldn't marry him. Found two weddin' bands in his pocket. Feisty little I-taliun.""
I see police and reporters in the tiny room. Mumbles spill into the hallway, but nobody really looks at the dead woman's face.
""Well,"" Mom says, ""at least they was still wearin' their clothes.""
The rain slows, and for a long time I sit watching the blue chicory swaying beside the road. I think of all the people I know who left these hills. Only Jim and Pop came back to the land, worked it.
""Lookee at the willow wisps."" Mom points to the hills.
The rain trickles, and as it seeps in to cool the ground, a fog rises. The fog curls little ghosts into the branches and gullies. The sun tries to sift through this mist, but is only a tarnished brown splotch in the pinkish sky. Wherever the fog is, the light is a burnished orange.
""Can't recall the name Pop gave it,"" I say.
The colors shift, trade tones.
'He had some funny names all right. Called a tomcat a 'pussy scat.'""
I think back. ""Cornflakes were 'pone-rakes,' and a chicken was a 'sick-un.'""
We laugh.
'Well,"" she says, ""he'll always be a part of us.""
The glommy paint on the chair arm packs under my fingernails. I think how she could foul up a free lunch.
I stand up to go in, but I hold the screen, look for something to say.
'I ain't going to live in Akron,"" I say.
'An' just where you gonna live, Mister?""
""I don't know.""
She starts up with her fan again.
'Me and Ginny's going low-riding,"" I say.
She won't look at me. ""Get in early. Mr. Trent don't keep no late hours for no beer drinkers.""
The house is quiet, and I can hear her out there sniffling. But what to hell can I do about it? I hurry to wash the smell of turkle from my hands. I shake all over while the water flows down. I talked back. I've never talked back. I'm scared, but I stop shaking. Ginny can't see me shaking. I just walk out to the road without ever looking back to the porch.
I climb in the car, let Ginny kiss my cheek. She looks different. I've never seen these clothes, and she wears too much jewelry.
""You look great,"" she says. ""Haven't changed a bit""
'We drive west along the Pike.
""Where we going?""
She says, ""Let's park for old times' sake. How's the depot?""
I say, ""Sure."" I reach back for a can of Falls City. ""You let your hair grow.""
""You like?""
""Um, yeah.""
We drive. I look at the tinged fog, the colors changing hue.
She says, ""Sort of an eerie evening, huh?"" It all comes from her beak.
""Pop always called it a fool's fire or something.""
We pull in beside the old depot. It's mostly boarded up. We drink, watch the colors slip to gray dusk in the sky.
""You ever look in your yearbook?"" I gulp down the rest of my City.
She goes crazy laughing. ""You know,"" she says, ""I don't even know where I put that thing.""
I feel way too mean to say anything. I look across the railroad to a field sown in timothy. There are wells there, pumps to suck the ancient gases. The gas burns blue, and I wonder if the ancient sun was blue. The tracks run on till they're a dot in the brown haze. They give off clicks from their switches. Some tankers wait on the spur. Their wheels are rusting to the tracks. I wonder what to hell I ever wanted with trilobites.
""Big night in Rock Camp,"" I say. I watch Ginny drink. Her skin is so white it glows yellowish, and the last light makes sparks in her red hair.
She says, ""Daddy would raise hell. Me this close to the wells.""
""You're a big girl now. C'mon, let's walk.""
We get out, and she up and grabs my arm. Her fingers feel like ribbons on the veins of my hand.
""How long you in for?"" I say.
""Just a week here, then a week with Daddy in New York. I can't wait to get back. It's great.""
""You got a guy?""
She looks at me with this funny smile of hers. ""Yeah, I got a guy. He's doing plankton research.""
Ever since I talked back, I've been afraid, but now I hurt again. We come to the tankers, and she takes hold on a ladder, steps up.
""This right?"" She looks funny, all crouched in like she's just nailed a drag on the fly. I laugh.
""Nail the end nearest the engine. If you slip, you get throwed clear. Way you are a drag on the fiy'd suck you under. 'Sides, nobody'd ride a tanker.""
She steps down, but doesn't take my hand. ""He taught you everything. What killed him?""
""Little shell fragment. Been in him since the war. Got in his blood . . ."" I snap my fingers. I want to talk, but the picture won't become words. I see myself scattered, every cell miles from the others. I pull them back and kneel in the dark grass. I roll the body faceup, and look in the eyes a long time before I shut them. ""You never talk about your momma,"" I say.
She says, ""1 don't want to,"" and goes running to an open window in the depot. She peeks in, turns to me. ""Can we go in?""
""Why? Nothing in there but old freight scales.""
""Because it's spooky and neat and I want to."" She runs back, kisses me on the cheek. ""I'm bored with this glum look. Smile!""
I give up, and walk to the depot. I drag a rotten bench under the broken window, and climb in. I take Ginny's hand to help her. A blade of glass slices her forearm. The cut path is shallow, but I take off my T-shirt to wrap it. The blood blots purple on the cloth.
""Hurt?""
'Not really.""
I watch a mud dauber land on the glass blade. Its metal-blue wings flick as it walks the edge. It sucks what the glass has scraped from her skin. I hear them working in the walls.
Ginny is at the other window, and she peers through a knothole in the plywood.
I say, ""See that light green spot on the second hill?""
""Yeah.""
""That's the copper on your-all's roof.""
She turns, stares at me.
""I come here lots,"" I say. I breathe the musty air. I turn away from her, and look out the window to Company Hill, but I can feel her stare. Company Hill looks bigger in the dusk, and I think of all the hills around town I've never set foot on. Ginny comes up behind me, and there's a glass-crunch with her steps. The hurt arm goes around me, the tiny spot of blood cold against my back.
""What is it, Colly? Why can't we have any fun?""
""When I was a young punk, I tried to run away from home. I was walking through this meadow on the other side of the Hill, and this shadow passed over me. I honest to god thought it was a pterodactyl. It was a damned airplane. I was so damn mad, I came home."" I peel chips of paint from the window frame, wait for her to talk. She leans against me, and I kiss her real deep. Her waist bunches in my hands. The skin of her neck is almost too white in the faded evening. I know she doesn't understand.
I slide her to the floor. Her scent rises to me, and I shove crates aside to make room. I don't wait. She isn't making love, she's getting laid. All right, I think, all right. Get laid. I pull her pants around her ankles, rut her. I think of Tinker's sister. Ginny isn't here. Tinker's sister is under me. A wash of blue light passes over me. I open my eyes to the floor, smell that tang of rain- wet wood. Black snakes. It was the only time he had to whip me.
""Let me go with you,"" I say. I want to be sorry, but I can't.
""Colly, please. . ."" She shoves me back. Her head is rolling in splinters of paint and glass.
I look a long time at the hollow shadows hiding her eyes. She is somebody I met a long time ago. I can't remember her name for a minute, then it comes back to me. I sit against the wall and my spine aches. I listen to the mud daubers building nests, and trace a finger along her throat.
She says, ""I want to go. My arm hurts."" Her voice comes from someplace deep in her chest.
We climb out. A yellow light burns on the crossties, and the switches click. Far away, I hear a train. She gives me my shirt, and gets in her car. I stand there looking at the blood spots on the cloth. I feel old as hell. When I look up, her taillights are reddish blurs in the fog.
I walk around to the platform, slump on the bench. The evening cools my eyelids. I think of how that one time was the only airplane that ever passed over me.
I picture my father—a young hobo with the Michigan sunset making him squint, the lake behind him. His face is hard from all the days and places he fought to live in, and of a sudden, I know his mistake was coming back here to set that locust-tree post on the knob.
""Ever notice how only blue lightning bugs come out after a rain? Green ones almost never do.""
I hear the train coming. She is highballing all right. No stiffs in that blind baggage.
""Well, you know the Teays must of been a big river. Just stand on Company Hill, and look across the bottoms. You'll see.""
My skin is heavy with her noise. Her light cuts a wide slice in the fog. No stiff in his right mind could try this one on the fly. She's hell-bent for election.
""Jim said it flowed west by northwest—all the way up to the old St. Lawrence Drain. Had garfish—ten, maybe twenty foot long. Said they're still in there.""
Good old Jim'll probably croak on a lie like that. I watch her beat by. A worn-out tie belches mud with her weight. She's just too fast to jump. Plain and simple.
I get up. I'll spend tonight at home. I've got eyes to shut in Michigan—maybe even Germany or China, I don't know yet. I walk, but I'm not scared. I feel my fear moving away in rings through time for a million years."

The continent of Atlantis was an island
Which lay before the great flood
In the area we now call the Atlantic Ocean
So great an area of land
That from her western shores
Those beautiful sailors journeyed
To the South and the North Americas with ease
In their ships with painted sails
To the East Africa was her neighbor
Across a short strait of sea miles
The great Egyptian age is but a remnant of the Atlantean culture
The antediluvian kings colonised the world
All the Gods who play in the mythological dramas
In all legends from all lands were from fair Atlantis
Knowing her fate
Atlantis sent out ships to all corners of the Earth
On board were the Twelve
The poet, the physician, the farmer, the scientist, the magician
And the other so-called Gods of our legends
Though Gods they were
And as the elders of our time choose to remain blind
Let us rejoice and let us sing
And dance and ring in the new
Hail Atlantis!
{Chorus}
Way down below the ocean, where I wanna be, she may be
Way down below the ocean, where I wanna be, she may be
Way down below the ocean, where I wanna be, she may be
Way down below the ocean, where I wanna be, she may be
Way down below the ocean, where I wanna be, she may be

My antediluvian baby, oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I wanna see you someday
My antediluvian baby, oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah

You've painted up your lips and rolled and curled your tinted hair
Ruby are you contemplating going out somewhere?
The shadows on the wall tell me the sun is going down
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town
It wasn't me that started that old crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore
And yes, it's true that I'm not the man I used to be
Oh Ruby, I still need some company
It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralyzed
And the wants and needs of a woman your age Ruby, I realize
But it won't be long, I've heard them say, until I'm not around
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town
She's leaving now cause I just heard the slamming of the door
The way I know I heard its slams one hundred times before
And if I could move I'd get my gun and put her in the ground
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town
Oh Ruby, for God's sake, turn around

Because your love has passed me by
You took me by surprise
You didn't realize but I was waiting
Time goes slowly, but carries on
And now the best years have come and gone
You took me by surprise
I didn't realize that you were laughing
Laughing, cause you're doin' it to me
Laughing, it ain't the way it should be
You took away everything I had
You put the hurt on me

You took away everything I had
You put the hurt on me
I go alone now, calling your name
After losing at the game

It was beautiful and so sweet
But now it's nothing
Nothing without you, baby
My whole world is incomplete
'Cause honey I can't see you no more
That was all that you said, baby
But you just might as well have
Placed a gun to my head
Baby, baby, oh, why did you do it

My whole world ended
The moment you left me
Yeah, yes it did, honey
My whole world ended
The moment you left me
It tumbled down to the ground, baby

Did you ever mean those sweet things
Ah, that you use to say
Did you mean 'em baby
Of a house with a lovely, lovely garden
And a little baby someday
Oh, tell me, baby
Where did I go wrong, honey
Whatever changed your mind, baby
I've asked myself these questions over a million times
Baby, baby, oh, baby

My whole world ended
The moment you left me
Oh, yes it did, baby, baby
My whole world ended
The moment you left me
It tumbled down to the ground, baby, baby, baby

Oh baby, now my body is numb
I feel, feel so senseless to the touch
My life is so wasted
So wasted without you
I guess I love too much, too much
Oh, baby, how can I face tomorrow
When yesterday is all I see
I just don't want to face tomorrow
If you're not sharing it with me
Baby, baby, oh, tell me why

My whole world ended
The moment you left me
Oh, yes it did, baby, baby
My whole world ended
The moment you left me
It tumbled down to the ground
Baby, I keep holding on, holding on
Although your love is gone, baby"

The world owes you a living
Sweet cream ladies, do your part
Think of what you're giving
To the lost and lonely people of the night
Out of need, they seek direction for their life
They will love you in the darkness
Take advantage of your starkness
And refuse to recognize you in the light
Sweet cream ladies, forward march;
Think what you're providing
Sweet cream ladies, show your starch;
What's the use of hiding?
Tell the socialites to look the other way;
It's instinctive stimulation you convey
It's a necessary function
Meant for those without compunction
Who get tired of vanilla every day
Sweet cream ladies forward march;
Puritans ignore them
Sweet cream ladies do their part;
Sweet cream men adore them
Let them satisfy the ego of the male
Let them fabricate success to those who fail
And should penalties pursue them
When there's really credit due them
They might keep a simple fellow out of jail!
Sweet cream ladies, forward march. O-o-o"
