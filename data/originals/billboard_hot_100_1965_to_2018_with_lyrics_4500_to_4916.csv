Diddy (Hey, what up, girl?)
Grab my glasses, I'm out the door, I'm gonna hit this city (Let's go)
Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't coming back

I'm talkin' pedicure on our toes, toes
Tryin' on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowin' up our phones, phones
Drop-toppin', playin' our favorite CDs
Pullin' up to the parties
Tryna get a little bit tipsy

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight
Till we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock
But the party don't stop, no

But the party don't stop, no
Oh, whoa, whoa, oh
Oh, whoa, whoa, oh

Ain't got a care in the world, but got plenty of beer
Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here
And now the dudes are linin' up 'cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger

I'm talkin' about errbody gettin' crunk, crunk
Boys try to touch my junk, junk
Gonna smack him if he gettin' too drunk, drunk
Now, now we go until they kick us out, out
Or the police shut us down, down
Police shut us down, down
Po-po shut us down

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight

Tick tock on the clock

""Hey, yeah, it's me, just been thinking about everything that night
I don't know, I just miss you so much
Can you call me back?""

Picture perfect memories
Scattered all around the floor
Reachin' for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me, it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

Another shot of whiskey
Can't stop lookin' at the door
Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me, it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now
Whoa, oh

I guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothin' at all

It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldn't call, but I'm a little drunk and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

I just need you now
Oh baby, I need you now"

Your lipstick stains
On the front lobe of my left side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you
And so I went and let you
Blow my mind
Your sweet moonbeam
The smell of you
In every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided
You're the one I have decided
Who's one of my kind

Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister
On the radio, stereo
The way you move ain't fair you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't want to miss a
Single thing you do, tonight

Just in time
I'm so glad you have
A one track mind like me
You gave my life direction
A game show love connection
We can't deny
I'm so obsessed
My heart is bound to beat right out
My untrimmed chest
I believe in you, like a virgin you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna
Blow your mind

Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister
On the radio, stereo
The way you move ain't fair you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't want to miss a
Single thing you do, tonight

Way you can cut a rug
Watching you's the only drug I need
You're so gangster, I'm so thug
You're the only one I'm dreaming of you see
I can be myself now finally
In fact there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you be, with me

Hey, soul sister

Let's take a journey

I know a place where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sipping gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (Undone)
The boys break their necks
Trying to creep a little sneak peek (At us)

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Sex (Sex) on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep ​*horn honks*​
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo, oh-oh

You could travel the world (You could travel the world)
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us (Once you party with us)
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

California gurls, we're unforgettable (California)
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle

California gurls (California), we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent (West Coast), now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Toned, tan, fit and ready
Turn it up cause it's getting heavy
Wild, wild, West Coast
These are the girls I love the most
I mean the ones, I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns (Uh!)
The girl's a freak
She drive a Jeep and live on the beach
I'm okay, I won't play
I love the Bay just like I love L.A
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything
Homeboys banging out
All that ass hanging out
Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis, no weenies
Just the king and a queenie
Katy, my lady (Yeah?)
Lookie here, baby (Uh-huh)
I'm all up on ya
'Cause you representing California (Oh-oh, yeah)

California gurls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle

In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

Yeah, I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you starin' at that phone in your lap
And you hopin' but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for if you had one chance?
So airplane, airplane, sorry I'm late
I'm on my way, so don't close that gate
If I don't make that, then I'll switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

Yeah, yeah, somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job, before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah, back when I was tryna get a tip at Subway
And back when I was rappin' for the hell of it
But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant
I'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes out of airplanes
Then maybe, oh maybe, I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decatur—what's up, Bobby Ray?
So can I get a wish to end the politics?
And get back to the music that started this shit?
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hopin' we can make some wishes out of airplanes

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

I could really use a wish right now
I, I, I could really use a wish right now
Like, like, like shooting stars
I, I, I could really use a wish right now

(Matthew 2:11; Mark 15:23; John 11:49-52, 19:39; Isaiah 53:1-12; Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:4-7)
Don't understand why they brought You myrrh
But that's all right because I like Your day of birth
Don't understand why You'd heal, me, Christ
But that's all right because I lived the day You died
I lived the day You died
I can't tell you what a thrill it is
Like in bowling when you got your first strike
It's like now I'm hitchhiking on the turnpike
I broke free from doin' life, now it's midnight
Then God comes along with a ride, invites me inside
I offer stuff to compensate
He doesn't want no payment – says, Brother, it's all be covered
It's tough to take – I say, Lord, I'm a lousy clown, why'd You stop to save me
You must be crazy, man, I'm such a waste
Where we goin'? I'm redeeming you – no you ain't
I'm bad, and someone like that can't become a saint
It's too ingrained – He said, there's no one good – you're goin' straight
I took command, and I'm winnin' you back – your soul is saved
But, Lord, my past was awful, I feel so estranged
I'm trapped – Who trapped you? I don't see no ball and chain
I laid hands on you – you'll never do this alone again
I guess you don't know the Lord's grace
Don't understand why they brought You myrrh
But that's all right because I like Your day of birth
Don't understand why You'd heal, me, Christ
But that's all right because I lived the day You died
I lived the day You died
I lived the day You died
You know, they struck His body so much
He could breathe when they hit Him
But Jesus, He did not refuse, even though they whipped Him
Not a warm, fuzzy feeling, gettin' killed just for livin'
Like He's some punk they didn't know from Adam
The Lord, He said, forgive 'em
When they did those things to hurt Him
Though they spit upon His face and invented stuff to curse and convict Him
They plucked out his facial hair
Laughed while givin' Him a thorny crown
Pinned Him to a cross in the Roman mannerism
Yet they gave Him a cold drink to cope with though
Something infinitesimal, a gesture made
Guess that they didn't know that in their painkilling recipe
Something was left over from a different day
One that came with frankincense and gold
It was embalmer's myrrh
Mixed with wine – He still refrained
You don't get it, Wonder Man, Christ was not immune to pain
But it's not in vain
Now the rest of us receive God's forgiveness
Guess that's why they say ""no pain no gain""
Don't understand why they brought You myrrh
But that's all right because I like Your day of birth
Don't understand why You'd heal, me, Christ
But that's all right because I lived the day You died
I lived the day You died
I lived the day You died
Now I know I said things, did things that were pretty mean
And we fall back to the days of Adam and days of Eve
But Your temptation was bad as mine is, from A to Z
Yet You never flunked the test like I did
You made it clean somehow
They cussed at You, nailed You to a tree
Maybe it was Satan just shiftin' the blame to You from me
Maybe that's what happens when some fourth graders meet with Darth Vader
All I know is the devil's too much for us to face now
The Messiah picked up my tab 'cause He died for all
Though I see sin starin' me in my face when I fall
Though I'm just a slimeball
Took me in when I called
Yes, I'm enlistin' as a Christian disciple
Guess it's time here for me to testify
I will follow Christ even through my lowest times
""Cause I know I became righteous from the fact I know my Messiah
If the devil tries to sucker me again
I'm a try and do my best to just renounce that liar
Don't understand why they brought You myrrh
But that's all right because I like Your day of birth
Don't understand why You'd heal, me, Christ
But that's all right because I lived the day You died
I lived the day You died
I lived the day You died"

With no directions, just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, livin' in the summer sun
And so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly, I ended up with none

There's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinkin' maybe I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant, but I was wonderin'
If there was somethin' that you wanna know (That you wanna know)
But never mind that, we should let it go (We should let it go)

I-I-I-I can make your bed rock, girl (Kane is in the building, nigga)
I-I-I-I can make your bed rock
I-I-I-I can make your bed rock

Uh, she got that good-good, she Michael Jackson bad
I'm attracted to her, or her attractive ass
And now we murderers, because we kill time
I knock her lights out and she still shine
I hate to see her go but I love to watch her leave
But I keep her running back and forth; soccer team
Cold as a winter's day, hot as a summer's eve
Young Money thieves steal your love and leave

I like the way you walking if you walking my way
I'm that Red Bull, now let's fly away
Let's buy a place, with all kind of space
I'll let you be the judge, and-and-and I'm the case
I'm Gudda Gudda, I put her under
I see me with her, no Stevie Wonder
She don't ever wonder, 'cause she know she bad
And I got her, nigga: grocery bag

Ooh baby, I be stuck to you like glue, baby
Wanna spend it all on you, baby
My room is the G-spot
Call me Mr. Flintstone, I can make your bed rock

(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock, girl
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock (Ayy!)

Okay, I get it, let me think, I guess it's my turn
Maybe it's time to put this pussy on your sideburns
He say I'm bad, he prob'ly right
He pressing me like button-downs on a Friday night
I'm so pretty like, be on my pedal bike
Be on my low starch, be on my egg whites
He say, ""Nicki don't stop, you the bestest""
And I'd just be coming off the top, asbestos

I love your sushi roll, hotter than wasabi
I race for your love, ""Shake'n Bake"" Ricky Bobby
I'm at the W, but I can't meet you in the lobby
Girl, I gotta watch my back, 'cause I'm not just anybody
I seen em stand in line just to get beside her
I let her see the Aston and let the rest surprise her
That's when we disappear, you need GPS to find her
Oh, that was your girl? I thought I recognized her

Ooh baby, I be stuck to you like glue, baby
Wanna spend it all on you, baby
My room is the G-spot
Call me Mr. Flintstone, I can make your bed rock

(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock (Ayy!)

She like tanning, I like staying in
She like romance and I like rolling with friends
She said I'm caged in, I think her conscience is
She's watching that Oxygen, I'm watching ESPN
But when that show ends, she all over my skin, lotion
Slow-mo motions, rollercoastin'
Like back, forth, hold it
She poses like it's for posters and I poke like I'm suppose to
Take this photo if you for me, she said: ""Don't you ever show this!""
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it, said ""Your words get me open""
So I closed it, where your clothes is?
I'm only loving for the moment

She ain't got a man, but she's not alone
Miss Independent, yeah, she got her own
Hey gorgeous, um, I mean flawless, well
That's what you are, how I see it is how I call it, yeah
Look-look at how she walk, m-hmm, she know she bad
Do your thang baby, I ain't even mad
And I ain’t leavin' fast, I'ma stay awhile
Hold your head, Chris, I-I'ma take it down!

Ooh baby, I be stuck to you like glue, baby
Wanna spend it all on you, baby
My room is the G-spot
Call me Mr. Flintstone, I can make your bed rock

Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, ""Do I look okay?""
I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing just the way you are

Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day
Oh you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are

The whole world stops and stares for a while

The world better prepare (For what?) for when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh, when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Let's go)

I be playing basketball with the president
Dunking on his delegates
Then I compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli' in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twennies, tens, and bens completely separate
And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me
Would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet
And put it in the air and sing

I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad (So bad)
Buy all of the things I never had (Buy everything, ha-ha)
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen (What up, Oprah? Ha-ha)

Oh, every time I close my eyes (What you see, what you see brah?)
I see my name in shiny lights (Uh-ha, uh-ha, yeah, what else?)
Oh, yeah, yeah, a different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare (For what?) for when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Sing it) when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)

I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad"

To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We’ll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you’re not alone
Holla if you feel like you’ve been down the same road

Yeah, it's been a ride
I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're tryna get out, just follow me
I'll get you there

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it
I don't give a damn what you think, I'm doin' this for me
So fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me
I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
Like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas, his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

I’m not afraid (I’m not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We’ll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you’re not alone
Holla if you feel like you’ve been down the same road

Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm
For you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack-blaow
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
This fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

I’m not afraid (I’m not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We’ll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you’re not alone
Holla if you feel like you’ve been down the same road

And I just can’t keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I’m breakin' out of this cage
I’m standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I’m mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I’ve had enough, now I’m so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it
‘Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
‘Cause I'm raisin' the bar
I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazin', and I'm—

I’m not afraid (I’m not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We’ll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you’re not alone
Holla if you feel like you’ve been down the same road"

Or maybe just need some sleep

I'm seeing it in my dreams
I'm looking down every alley
I'm making those desperate calls
I'm staying up all night hoping
Hitting my head against the wall

What you've got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

Won't listen to any advice
Momma's telling me I should think twice
Better left to my own devices
I'm addicted, it's a crisis
My friends think I've gone crazy
My judgment's getting kinda hazy
My steeze is gonna be affected
If I keep it up like a lovesick crackhead

What you've got, boy, is hard to find

The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave

Hey, so I got a question
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum?
Is my love with your drug? Your drug
Huh, your drug
Huh, your drug
Is my love your drug?

Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug

Because your love, your love, your love is my drug

If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
The disco ball is just hanging by a thread

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep?
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep (Haha)

To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell (Said farewell)
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (Jar, jar, jar)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Because my dreams are bursting at the seams"

Practice in front of that mirror, now you doing it on the dance flo'
Mad 'cause I can't get with you, chick, just show me how to dance, oh

I'm finally putting my YouTube videos up all in one place. People have been telling me I needed to do that for a long time so that's what I'm gonna do and I'm gonna do a little intro on all of them. You see, I'd been kicking around the idea of doing reviews, I'd seen, The Nostalgia Critic and Angry Video Game Nerd, I'd seen them do it for a long time and a huge fan. And I'd never found a good reason or, the motivation to actually try it and then I had the idea to do the pop song reviews. And I'd been writing, reviews of songs in my blog – which is long gone by now, you can't find it – but I'd been doing reviews on my blog for a long time. And, I was scared of showing my face, then I had this great idea of this image of this silhouette guy sitting at his piano – he can play piano and I just loved the image of it so I couldn't stop myself from doing it. I was just so excited by it and this is the first episode, the humble, very humble beginning of Todd In The Shadows. This was so much harder than I thought it was gonna be and I'm not sure why I picked such an innocuous song to start off with – who's really bothered by ""Down"" by Jay Sean? And I started on it, I figured it would be easy, and I found out I couldn't figure out how to do anything: I didn't know how to act, I didn't know how to write, I didn't know how to edit, I didn't know how to film, I didn't know how to frame – I still  don't know how much I've really learned about this since I've started but, eh, you had to start somewhere. I started with this for some reason. It's rough but it was a start, so – ""Down"" by Jay Sean, enjoy.
                                            ""Down"" by Jay Sean                                                   ft/Lil Wayne                                             A pop song review
Hello, friends! If you'll just give me a moment, I'd like to indulge in one of my favorite past-times: over-analyzing cheap pop songs. So, there's one song I wanna look at in particular – you may have heard it – it's Jay Sean's ""Down.""

Now, maybe you don't pay attention to the pop charts but I do and this song is everywhere – I mean, it's on the pop stations, it's on the country stations, it's on the gospel stations, the Rush Limbaugh stations, and it's an impressive feat for a song that's only a word long.
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down
Even if the sky is falling downSee? He even rhymes ""down"" with ""down!"" Although I can't be too surprised it's a hit song right now – I mean, it sounds like everything else on the radio, I mean everything else.
You down, down, down, down?
Low, low, low, low
Right now, na, na
With you, with you, with you, with youI've never heard a song that sounds this much like everything. I mean, it even has the now-required cameo from Lil Wayne, who always sounds like he's going through puberty.
Down like she supposed to be
She gets down low for me
Down like her temperature
'Cause, to me, she's zero degreesUh... did Lil Wayne just lose control of his metaphor there? I always thought if you say a girl's zero degrees frozen, that means she wasn't into you. I don't know. Also, why is he dressed like the guy from The White Stripes?
Cold, over freeze
I got that girl from overseas
Now she's my Miss America
Now can I be her soldier please?
Did he just say ""She's my Miss America"" and then salute a British flag?

Honestly, I'm down like the economyHa! That's clever... ""down like the economy."" I don't have a job. Thanks for the reminder, Lil Wayne.
Here's an interesting fact: Jay Sean is the first major pop singer of Sikh descent.
Yeah, that's right. Just goes to show you that the pop charts are an all-inclusive place, open to all creeds and all colors and all cultures as long as they sound like everything else.
I'm kinda amused that the guy's named Jay Sean. He just had to have a name as generic as his song. I mean, it's Jay Sean! You know Jay Sean, I know Jay Sean, everyone knows Jay Sean! Jay Sean's a star, we live in a Jay Sean era of music. Jay Sean, Jay... we've already got a bunch of Jays.


And we've already got a bunch of Seans.


We certainly don't need a Jay Sean. Hey, wait a minute, is this the same guy that did ""Tipsy"" a few years back?

""Everybody in the club gettin' tipsy, yeah!"" 
No, I am informed that this is, in fact, J Kwon. J Kwon, not Jay Sean. 
I mean, I don't even hate this song. I kinda like this song a little. It's just something you don't think about – it just goes through you. You don't wake up in the morning wanting to hear ""Down"" by Jay Sean. It's not something you can connect to. I mean, ""Are you down?"" is not really a very romantic sentiment. ""Do you agree, agree, agree, agree, agree, agree? Are you comfortable with the terms of this proposal?"" I mean, if you're going to be repeating one word over and over again, why is it ""down?"" Why isn't it something like ""love"" or ""yours"" or ""forever"" or... uh, forever. Hey, hold on, lemme check something here.

Down, down
Baby, are you down, down, down, down?
It's like I've waited my whole life for this one night
It's gon' be me, you—
Oh, my God! It's ""Forever"" by Chris Brown!

""Down"" by Jay Sean is the same as ""Forever"" by Chris Brown! I mean, the melodies are a little different but, mostly, it's the same song!
You won't be lonelyDouble your pleasureI mean, they got the same tempo, they got the same chord structure, they're both about whisking away on a magic, flying carpet to the eternal dance floor of love. There's not a major difference! This is great! This is just great because ""Forever"" was Chris Brown's only good song, and now we don't even have to listen to that anymore 'cause we've got Jay Sean's ""Down"" to replace it so we can just delete this guy from the cultural memory banks forever. Awesome. See, Jay Sean, you do have a purpose: you're the new and improved Chris Brown.

NOW WITH 31% LESS DOMESTIC ABUSE!
That's great, I'm glad you're around.

Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down...

There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us, nor could ever come above
She had me going crazy
Oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily, don’t need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground, but I really want to see her on the weekend
She knows she's got me dazing, cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking, but I just keep on saying

Left a small town and never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lying on the couch
The moment, I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about:

Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone.""

You said, ""I remember how we felt, sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

4548,48,Live Like We're Dying,Kris Allen,2010,live like were dying,allen kriskris allen,,,1,"Ohh, yeah, yeah

Sometimes we fall down, can't get back up
We're hiding behind skin that's too tough
How come we don't say I love you enough?
Till it's to late, it's not too late

Our hearts are hungry for a food that won't come
And we could make a feast from these crumbs
And we're all staring down the barrel of a gun
So if your life flashed before you
What would you wish you would've done?

Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got then we gotta start thinking
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell them that we love them while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying

And if your plane fell out of the skies
Who would you call with your last goodbye?
Should be so careful who we let fall out our lives
'Cause when we long for absolution
There'll no one on the line, yeah

Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got then we gotta start thinking
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell them that we love them while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying
Like we're dying, oh, like we're dying
Like we're dying, oh, like we're dying

Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got then we gotta start thinking
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
Yeah, mmm

You never know a good thing till it's gone
You never see a crash till it's head on
Why do we think we're right when we're dead wrong?
You never know a good thing till it's gone

Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got then we gotta start thinking
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell them that we love them while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying
Like we're dying, oh, like we're dying
Like we're dying, oh, like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell them that we love them while we got the chance to say

I used to run my whole block like Obama and them
You ain't gotta believe me, go ask my momma and them
Couldn't even come in my room, smelled like a kilo
Look like me and two of my boys playing casino
Count the style I keep in my bag, they can't afford it
Tell 'em ""give me back my swag!"" They tryna clone it
See my Louis chucks, Louis flag, Louis frames, Louis belt
What that make me, ""Louis Mane""?
I'm in the all-white party wearing all black
With my new black watch, call it the heart attack
Cardiac arrest, Carti'ac a wrist
Yeah, they say they hard, they ain't hard as this
Hard: the one word describes me
If I wasn't doing this, you know where I'd be

Let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit
Life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever
So we live a life like a video
When the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold
And the music is always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop their pretty ass up on the hood of dat pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today
Cuz there is no tomorrow
Just some picture perfect day
To last a whole lifetime
And it never ends
Cos all we have to do is hit rewind
So lets just stay in the moment, smoke some weed
Drink some wine
Reminisce talk some shit forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark that can't erase neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut
I'll be fine
I'm forever young...
Fear not when, fear not why
Fear not much while were alive
Life is for living not living up tight
See ya somewhere up in the sky
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye
So not for legends, I'm forever young
My name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves
Over Pyrex pots, my name shall be passed down to generations
While debating up in barber shops, young slung, hung here
Shorty, the nigga from here
With a little ambition just what we can become here
And as the father passed his story down to his sons ears
Younger kid, younger every year, yeah
So if you love me baby this is how you let me know
Don't ever let me go, thats how you let me know, baby
Slamming Bentley doors
Hopping out of Porsche's
Popping up on Forbes lists
Gorgeous
Hold up
Niggas thought I lost it
They be talking bullshit
I be talking more shit
They nauseous
Hold up
I'll be here forever
You know, I'm on my fall shit
And I ain't waiting for closure, I will never forfeit

She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me

Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me"

There's a place downtown where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free for all
And they turn me on when they take it off
When they take it off, everybody take it off
There's a place I know if you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore and there's glitter on the floor
And they turn me on when they take it off
When they take it off, everybody take it off"

I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinking?
Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
About to set it off in this bitch: Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
""Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me neither""
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwing hundreds
When I should be throwing ones, bitch, I run it

I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

One thing 'bout music: when it hits, you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me
I know better than that, it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame
And I'm ready for that, I'm just saying
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on
If you thinking I'ma quit before I die, dream on
Man they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kidding?
Man nobody's ever done it like I did it, uh

I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over
Yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over"

- - - THANK YOU'S - - -
Words cannot accurately express the gratitude I feel towards the Universe for
Selecting me to become a character such as “B.o.B” and have the opportunity
To impact worldwide consciousness. I would also like to take this time to give
Credit for the parents who were courageous enough to give birth to a wild son
Such as myself, Bobby Simmons Sr. and Karen Simmons
Although I am the face of the movement, there is always a proper team
Behind any successful project. B-Rich, TJ Chapman, and Playboy Tre have been
Like uncles for me on my journey and constantly make sure that I’m grounded
We have put in a lot of blood, sweat, tears, pain, happiness, and patience into
What is unfolding and now we can celebrate the release of the debut album. I
Am grateful to have a team to invest so much time and energy into one project
HAM SQUAD ON DECK!!! SKLOOO!
Tiffany, first I have to thank you for all of the creative ideas and concepts that
You have given me out of the pure love for art. Secondly, I have to thank you for
Staying in my corner through my roughest times because if it were not for you
B.o.B would be lost
Since a year ago I have prayed that the Universe would bring musicians in
My life who were just as passionate about music as I am…well those prayers
Were answered which is why I am privileged to be working with awesome
Musicians such as Kyle King, Takehiko Kato, Arielle Simmons, and DeLarry
Sanders. Whether on the road or in the studio, the chemistry is divine
There have been very crucial bits of information and advice that I have
Received throughout my journeys into the Universe but the most impactful ones
Have come from my brother Jamaal. Thank you for listening to my horrible raps
Back in the day…now they’re not so bad eh? Gracias!
Stephen Hill - Although you are my cousin, you will always be my brother in
My eyes. From the days that we were sneaking into clubs, to the days that we
Were the Klinic, all of this started as a dream and has manifested into something
Way greater than what we envisioned. I have to express and acknowledge my
Gratitude for you inspiring me to be greater as a man and STAND UP! Lol
The Simmons Family
The Hill Family
Jim Jonsin - You have taught me so much in the studio and have shown me
How to really put my elbows into a record!! lol. I would like to thank you for
Believing in B.o.B since we walked into that studio in Miami that day! Rebel
Rock!!!!!
LaTrice Burnette - C’mon Son!!!!! You are one of the hardest working people
That I know alone! You go way over and beyond to make sure that me and
Team B.o.B are okay and we will always have a place in our hearts for you
You will always be family to us!
Sydney Margetson - Getting the word out to the masses about the existence of
B.o.B is something that would not have been possible without your contribution
To the project. It takes actual care and effort to pull that off. Thanks
Brian “Busy” Dackowski - Obviously from the name, you are always busy
Making sure we have the best looks, and the best ideas in this new age of
Internet and technology. So on behalf of myself and Team B.o.B…Thank you!

In a different life or where I record
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree
'S-s-s' on my chest 'cause I'm ready to save him
Ready to give up on anybody that plays him
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him

Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly

Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did, I did
And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot
I did

And now, when all is done, there is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won, you can go ahead, tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, Impossible

Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worse
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know
Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know, I know

And now, when all is gone, there is nothing to say
And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own, you can go ahead, tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken

Last name Ever—first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown—Nino
She insist she got more class—we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me—Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled—chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal—I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness

I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money; Benjamin Button ""What?"" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin

You would think these niggas know me, when they really doesn't

He ain't even go to class: Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?

And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top!""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover

There they go—packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go—Macadamian—they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow—fuck no!
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over—oh, no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth-fillings
Come flyin' up outta our mouths—now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you got at me—how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake—

Send it straight to gold

I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change

And you just stuck standin' there but
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa

It really sucks, but ever since I’ve been long gone
I traded in my señorita for a microphone
I hate the way you fell apart, girl, it's sad to see
Your life is good, but me and you it’s catastrophe
If I was unsuccessful, would you be satisfied?
I need a paramedic girl, I’m feeling paralyzed
If I could choose, you will always be a friend to me
The more money I made you acting like my enemy – it's crazy
I can’t help it if you feel ashamed
Thought the pressure would turn you into my diamond babe
How can something so familiar be so strange
Closest friends get estranged when the status change, ah
Is it my mistake, thinking that where I am and where you at?
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that had my back
You were the perfect pair and now it seems that we don’t match
Is it the money, want me to give it back?

I am the topic of conversation, this is celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I've moved out my mama's basement
To a condo downtown, 'cause it's all about location
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication, to life
You shoulda been here to kick it with me
We could have split this whole thing up 50/50
But now I'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever-so talented Mr. Ripley
How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should wanna go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gon' be hard to quit
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You could tell me that you've never heard none of my songs
Long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
'Cause what's a star when it's most important fan is missing?

There was something in your eyes, and it wasn't right
I should've walked, but I never had the chance
Everything got out of hand, and I let it slide

Now I only have myself to blame
For falling for your stupid games
I wish my life could be the way
It was before I saw your face

You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You had my heart, now, I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na

Now your photos don't have a picture frame
And I never say your name, and I never will
And all your things, well, I threw 'em in the trash
And I'm not even sad

Now you only have yourself to blame
For playing all those stupid games
You're always gonna be the same
Oh no, you'll never change

You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You had my heart, now, I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na na

You want my future, you can't have it
I'm still trying to erase you from my past
I need you gone so fast

You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You had my heart, now, I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely and took me for a ride
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it"

Who else is really trying to fuck with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G's bro
Flying Holly Grove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I be sipping, so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

Meet me on the fresh train, yes I'm in the building
You just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X-Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spinning, dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on a paper trail and ain't no telling where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killer but don't push me

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

How do you say what's never said?
Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red
Limping off tour, cause I made more on my second leg
Muthafuckin' Birdman Jr., 11th Grade
Ball on automatic start
I can hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments
Uh, now come on be my blood donor
Flow so nice you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big and let the small fall under that
Damn where you stumbled at? From where they make Gumbo at
Kane got the fucking beat jumping like a jumping jack
And you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack
Hip-Hop, I'm the heart of that
Nigga, nothing short of that
President Carter, Young Money Democrat

Now tell me how you love it

I just had to come back one last time
Ma'am, I know you don't know me from Adam
But these hand prints on the front steps are mine
Up those stairs, in that little back bedroom
Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar
And I bet you didn't know under that live oak
My favorite dog is buried in the yard

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me

Mama cut out pictures of houses for years
From 'Better Homes and Garden' magazine
Plans were drawn and concrete poured
Nail by nail and board by board
Daddy gave life to Mama's dream

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me

You leave home, you move on and you do the best you can
I got lost in this whole world and forgot who I am

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me"

I've never known the lovin' of man
But it sure felt nice when he was holdin' my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts—oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singin'
Funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

Ooh, ooh, the ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em
Oh, the sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls"

Deep in my soul, that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone, but keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now, I had sworn to myself
That I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

Spittin' out smoke on the side of the road
I'm out here alone just tryin' to get home
To tell you I was wrong, but you already know

Believe me, I won't stop at nothin'
To see you, so I've started runnin'

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinking that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you

Last time we talked, the night that I walked
Burns like an iron in the back of my mind
I must've been high to say you and I
Weren't meant to be and just wasting my time

Oh, why did I ever doubt you?
You know I would die here without you

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinking that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you

You and I, right or wrong, there's no other one
After this time I spent alone
It's hard to believe that a man with sight could be so blind
Thinkin' 'bout the better times, must've been outta my mind
So I'm runnin' back to tell you

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
Without you, God knows what I'd do, yeah

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinking that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through, yeah

You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold
Buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile

Even when you're gone
Somehow you come along
Just like a flower poking through the sidewalk crack
And just like that
You steal away the rain
And just like that

They gonna be on you when they see you hit that Dougie, right
Ain't nobody fuckin' with my bro from Morningside
He go by Bubba and he hit that dance like thunder
I ain't from Dallas but I D-Town boogie

Now you just do you and I'mma do me
Niggas love to hate so they try to screw me
Bitches be stuck to me, I think they try to glue me

I run it, run it even if her legs long
She like, you hubby
I think she love me
But I change the subject and I do my Dougie
Cause I don't give a fuck, blow trees, get money

And when I asked for some head the bitch looked at me funny
Duh, bitch you can't tell me nothin'
Starr made the beat, I just took it out the oven

Or just hold on to love
And I could find a way to make it
Don't hold on too tight
I'll make it without you tonight

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon"

Then I'mma probe you
See I abducted you
So I tell you what to do

Ocupe-se à noite
Porque cada vez mais faço o mal antes a Prius
Desesperado à noite
Posso te fazer minha rainha
E fazer amor com você infinitamente
Isso é insano, a maneira como o nome cresce, o dinheiro se mantém fluindo
Os trabalhadores se movem para o lado, então estou na ponta dos pés, mantenha fluindo
Fiquei trancado como a Lindsay Lohan
Coloque isso na minha vida, querida
Posso fazer te sentir bem, querida
Não posso prometer o amanhã
Mas prometo a noite

E se você pegá-las, pelo menos você está no topo do mundo
Pense nisso
Porque se você escorregar, eu irei cair em cima de você, garota
Coloque bolas quando eles dormirem no Macy's
E não há segredo
Minha avó é de Cuba, mas sou americano
Amarrado sobre o dinheiro, como Seacrest
Coloque isso na minha vida, querida

The whole world stops and stares for a while

If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same

Leopard print Speedo on the F.D.R. saying ""follow that car""
Same maze different shit name sake blanket pocked
49 miners slick pick and pan, thanks a lot
Hook and reel pushing wheels building more storied land
Honest deal daily dose, aching bone, quarry hand
I praise the day that porn began
Loser wins a cupie doll, not-the-father Maury dance
Saddle spin apple sins kings that cry
Ousted by the clergy we're not worthy of the crimson tide
Let it be just beware of prison pride
Proud Mary keep on burning down the house there’s kids inside
Give it time speaking soft send him in
Tell him what he’s here for and appear sure to his next of kin
Set your sails bed of nails elbow back
Trading in the British pound sitting down with Meadow's dad
Kettles black might explode sign the paper
Resuscitate me if the doctors are the kind that cater
Labor party line, primed with wine and wafer...
You’ll get buried in the desert like I’m Gator, hater!

Moth man morph devoid of a new cocoon
More aches in his joints than joints in his human suit
No cigar, scoop dirt smitty over hook-in-mouth
Foot work itchy for a hoof and snout, do or die intruder bound
Zoomed on the stupefying truancy of
Santa's little helpers watching millie pull her Brooklyn out
Part hex, part dark RX, part kill the headlights when approaching a harpy nest
Ever oscillating Arp noise, operate and charter stone hearts out of gargoyles
Ditto on the guard dogs, ruff!
This is not behavior distorted by the presence of other personage
More a naturally occurring perfect mess
Couriering letters from the burning bridge

Leggo

Yellow model chick, yellow bottle sippin'
Yellow Lamborghini, yellow top missin'
Yeah, yeah, that shit look like a toupée
I get what you get in 10 years in two days
Ladies love me, I'm on my Cool J
If you get what I get, what would you say?
She wax it all off, Mr. Miyagi
And them suicide doors, hari-kari

Look at me now, look at me now (Oh)
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now (Oh), look at me now (Yeah)
Fresher than a muh'fucka

Lil' nigga, bigger than gorilla
'Cause I'm killin' every nigga that can try to be on my shit
Better cuff your chick if you with her, I can get her
And she accidentally slip and fall on my dick
Oops, I said, ""On my dick""
I ain't really mean to say, ""On my dick""
But since we're talking about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it
I'm done

Ayo, Breezy
Let me show you how to keep the dice rollin'
When you're doin' that thing over there, homie
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Let's go!

'Cause I'm feelin' like I'm runnin'
And I'm feelin' like I gotta get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
'Cause you know I gotta win everyday-day (Go)
See, they really really wanna pop me (Blow)
Just know that you will never flop me (Oh)
And I know that I can be a little cocky (No)
You ain't never gonna stop me
Every time I come, a nigga gotta set it
Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it (Woo)
Then I gotta blow, and then I gotta show that
Any little thing a nigga think that he be doin' (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm gonna da-da-da-da (Damn)
Then I'm gonna murder everything and anything
A ba-da-boom, a ba-da-bing, I gotta do a lotta things
That make it clearer to a couple niggas
That I always win and then I gotta get it again and again and then again
And I be doin' it to death
And now I move a little foul, a nigga better call a ref
And everybody know my style and niggas know that I'm the best
When it come to doing this and I be bangin' on my chest
And I bang in the East and I'm bangin' in the West
And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you could read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next? (Let's go!)
See the way we on and then we all up in the race
And you know we gotta go, don't try to keep up with the pace
And we strugglin' and hustlin' and sendin' in and gettin' in
And we always gotta do it, take it to another place
Gotta taste it, and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through this traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne, better know I gotta have it (Have it)

Look at me now, look at me now (Oh)
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now (Oh), look at me now (Yeah)
Fresher than a muh'fucka

Man, fuck these bitch-ass niggas, how y'all doin'?
I'm Lil Tunechi, I'm a nuisance
I go stupid, I go dumb like the Three Stooges
I don't eat sushi, I'm the shit, no, I'm pollution, no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, pussy juicy
I never gave a fuck about a hater
Got money on my radar, dressed like a skater
Got a big house, came with a elevator
You niggas ain't eatin', fuck it, tell a waiter
Marley said shoot 'em, and I said okay
If you wanted bullshit, then I'm like, ""¡Olé!""
I don't care what you say, so don't even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
That's word to my flag, and my flag red
I'm out of my head, bitch, I'm outta my mind
From the bottom I climb, you ain't hotter than mine
Nope, not on my time, and I'm not even tryin'
What's poppin', slime? Nothin', five
And if they trippin', fuck 'em, five
I ain't got no time to shuck and jive
These niggas as sweet as pumpkin pie
CîROC and Sprite on a private flight
Bitch, I been tight since Guiding Light
And my pockets right, and my diamonds white
And my momma's nice, and my daddy's dead
You faggots scared 'cause I'm too wild
Been here for a while, I was like, ""Fuck trial""
I puts it down, I'm so Young Money
If you got eyes, look at me now, bitch!

Look at me now, look at me now (Haha! Oh)
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now (Haha! Oh), look at me now (Yeah)
I'm fresher than a muh'fucka

Okay
Okay
Is that right?

A little louder

You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

When you was just a young’un, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryning put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and crooks still crook

You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

See I just want you to know that you deserve the best
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful
Yeah, and I want you to know
You’re far from the usual, far from the usual

I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited

And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too

We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

Livin' out our dreams
We are right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

By the time you hear this, I will have already spiraled up
I would never do nothin' to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you I would duck, or get struck like lightnin'
Fighters keep fightin', put your lighters up, point 'em skyward, uh
Had a dream, I was king; I woke up, still king
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking
'Til nobody else even fuckin' feels me, 'til it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fuckin' illest in this music
There is, or there ever will be, disagree? Feel free
But from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave up's using no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped your life around, crock of shit
Who you dicks tryna kid? Flip ""dick,"" you did opposite
You stayed the same 'cause ""cock"" backwards is still ""cock,"" you pricks!
I love it when I tell 'em shove it
‘Cause it wasn’t that long ago when Marshall sat flustered
Lacked luster ‘cause he couldn’t cut mustard
Muster up nothin', brain fuzzy
‘Cause he’s buzzin’, woke up from that buzzer
Now you wonder why he does it how he does it
Wasn’t ‘cause he had buzzards
Circlin' around his head, waitin' for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it ‘cause some bitches wrote him off?
Little hussy-ass scuzzes
Fuck it, guess it doesn’t matter now, does it?
What difference it make? What’s it take?
To get it through your thick skulls that this ain’t
Some bullshit; people don’t usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switchblade to a hater’s ribcage!
And let it be known from this day forward, I wanna just say
Thanks, ‘cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let them Bics raise, ‘cause I came with 5'9"", but I feel like I’m 6'8""

This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We are right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

By the time you hear this, I’ll prob'ly already be outtie
I advance like goin' from totin' iron to goin' and buyin’
Four or five of the homies the Iron Man Audi
My daddy told me: ""Slow down, boy, you're goin' to blow it!""
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute to tell Shady I love him
The same way that he did Dr. Dre on The Chronic
Tell him how real he is, or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him, for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I write 'til he can march right
Into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's LeBron's Jersey in twenty years
I stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up, it's 'bout to be a scary drop
‘Cause what goes up must come down
You goin' down on somethin' you don't wanna see, like a hairy box
Every hour, happy hour now, life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cat's meow, oow, outclass the count
Always down for the catchweight like Pacquiao
Y'all are doomed
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself, and auto-tunes
‘Cause now I'm in the Aston; I went from havin'
My city locked up to gettin' treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic, compare it to a weed high
And y'all niggas that's gossipin' like bitches
On a radio and TV, see me, we fly
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams starin' at a beehive
And how real is that? I remember signin' my first deal
Now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag

You and I know what it's like
To be kicked down, forced to fight
But tonight, we're all right
So hold up your lights
Let it shine, 'cause—

This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We are right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters"

She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh, and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even gray, but she buries her baby

The sharp knife of a short life

And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the lovin' of man
But it sure felt nice when he was holdin' my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts—oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singin'
Funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

Ooh, ooh, the ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em
Oh, the sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls"

Just sing along to my stereo (Gym Class Heroes, baby!)

If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like yikky-yeah check it, Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks

'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artefacts

If I could only find a note to make you understand
I’d sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand

Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops? (Turn it up)
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop (Peace)
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like on the interstate (Never know)

I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you could hit it, sing along and take me by the hand

I'm back where I belong (Yeah)
I never felt so strong, man (I'm back, baby)
I feel like there's nothing I can't try
And if you feel me put your hands high (Put your hands high)
If you ever lost a light before, this one's for you
(Baby, put your hands high)
And you, the dreams are for you

I hear the ""Tears of a Clown,"" uh, I hate that song
I always feel like they're talking to me, when it comes on (come on)
Another day, another dawn
Another Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math, I'm gone
What am I supposed to do when the club lights come on?
It's easy to be Puff but it's harder to be Sean
What if my twins ask why I ain't marry their mom?
Damn, how do I respond?
What if my son stares with a face like my own
And says he wants to be like me when he's grown?
Shit! But I ain't finished growing
Another night, the inevitable prolongs
Another day, another dawn
Just tell Keisha and Teresa I'll be better in the morn'
(I'll be better in the morn')
Another lie that I carry on
I need to get back to the place where I belong

I'm coming home, I'm coming home (I'm coming home)
Tell the world that I'm coming home (Yeah)
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday (Ain't no more pain)
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes (Thank you)
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
(I'm coming home, I'm coming home)
Tell the world I'm coming home

“A House Is Not a Home,” I hate this song
Is a house really a home when your loved ones is gone?
And niggas got the nerve to blame you for it
And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it
But you felt it, and still feel it
And money can't make up for it or conceal it
But you deal with it (Deal with it), and you keep ballin'
Pour out some liquor, playboy, and we keep ballin' (Ballin')
Baby, we been living in sin
Cause we been really in love, but we been living as friends
So you've been a guest in your own home
It's time to make your house your home
Pick up your phone, come on

I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home (I'm coming home)
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes (Thank you)
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
(I'm coming home, I'm coming home)
Tell the world I'm coming

I'm almost home, check this out
“Ain’t No Stopping Us Now,” I love that song
Whenever it comes on, it makes me feel strong
I thought I told y'all that we won't stop
Til we back cruisin through Harlem, these old blocks
It's what made me, saved me, drove me crazy
Drove me away, then embraced me
Forgave me for all of my shortcomings
Welcome to my homecoming
Yeah, it's been a long time coming
Lot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles
Lot of cars, lot of ups, lot of downs
Made it back, lost my dog (I miss you Big!)
But here I stand (Here I stand), a better man (Don't stop)
Thank you, Lord! Thank you all!

I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home (I'm coming home)
Let the rain wash away (Feels so good)
All the pain of yesterday (Feels so free)
I know my kingdom awaits (Ain't no place like home, baby)
And they've forgiven my mistakes (Ain't no place like home)
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming"

Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat; call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy ‘cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted ‘cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit, and you niggas just runner-ups

Okay, I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these motherfuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasin', tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""
Bitch, real Gs move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant

Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well

And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love
Keep throwin' my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side

Load the truck up, hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire, spread the word
Light the bonfire, then call the girls
The king in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack 'n' Jim were a few good men
Where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said, she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something y'all don't know
Man that talk is getting old

Before I have to knock that loud mouth out

The way we were raised and our southern ways
And we like cornbread and biscuits
And if it's broke round here we fix it
I can take y'all where you need to go
Down to my hood, back in them woods
We do it different 'round here, that's right
But we sure do it good and we do it all night
See, if you really wanna know how it feels
To get off the road with trucks and four wheels
Jump on in, and man, tell your friends
We'll raise some hell where the blacktop ends

Chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones

To keep both my hands above the blanket

Uhh, I’m getting so throwed
I ain't went this hard since I was 18
Apologize if I say, anything I don’t mean
Like ""what's up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me
And what's up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy?""
But get it while you here, boy
'Cause all that hype don’t feel the same next year, boy
Yeah and I’ll be right here in my spot
With a little more cash than I already got
Trippin' off you 'cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient
Me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors, hate the bullshit
Hate these fucking allegations
I’m just feeling like the throne is for the taking
Watch me take it

All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one, yeah, fuck it I’m on one
Yeah, I said ""I’m on one"", fuck it I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I’m on one, I said ""Fuck it, I’m on one""

I’m burning purple flowers, it’s burning my chest
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear?
Burner in the belt, move the kids to the hills (Boss)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya ""everything is great""
Even though I'm out on bond and might be facing' 8
Still running with the same niggas 'til the death of me
Never seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London and she screams?
Baby, I could take ya there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So yeah, we on one, the feeling ain’t fair (Khaled)
And it’s double M G until I get the chair

All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody shoulda told ya

Money to be got and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I’m on one, I said ""fuck it, I’m on one""

I walk around the club, fuck everybody
And all my niggas got that Heat, I feel like Pat Riley
Yeah, too much money, ain't enough money
You know the feds listening, nigga what money?
I’m a maid nigga, I should dust something
You niggas on the bench, like the bus coming
Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the Swishers
I’m focused might as well say ""cheese"" for the pictures
Ohh, I’m about to go Andre the Giant
You a sell out, but I ain't buying
Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to your world like the Mayans
This a celebration bitches, Mazel tov
It’s a slim chance I fall, Olive Oyl
Tunechi be the name, don’t ask me how I got it
I’m killin’ these hoes I swear I’m tryna stop the violence
(Young Mula baby, YMCMB)

All I care about is money and the city that I'm from

Uzun zamandır yoxsan
Zamanım tükənir
Mənə bir həkim lazım, mənə bir həkim çağırın
Mənə bir həkim lazım, məni həyata geri gətirməsi üçün

Bütün dünyaya söylədim, bir gün borcumu geri ödəcəyəm
Bunu kasetdə saxladım, bir gün kaseti yenidən oxuda bilim
Amma bunu söyləyərkən mən belə inanmırdım
Şübhə getdikcə yaxınlaşır
Hər günüm ya qara, ya da boz
Ümid, mənə sadəcə bir zərrəsi lazım
Çünki, kimsə mənim gördüyümü görmür
Musiqimlə söyləməyə çalışdığımda bərbad deyirlər
Onlar mükəmməlin nə olduğunu bilmirlər
Bunu yazarkən ayıq olub-olmadığımı belə bilmirəm
Tək bildiyim şey bu pis günlərimdə yanımda olmağının zərurəti
Mənə dayaq oldun, yeni bir həyat verdin
Bütün bunları sənə borcluyam
Amma niyə mənim gördüyüm kimi görə bilmədiyini anlamıram
Bu içimdən gəldi, sən oğlunu itirdin
İblislər səninlə vuruşur, hər yer qaranlıq
İzn ver işıqları yandırıb hər yeri aydınladım və nə olduğunu görməyinə şərait yaradım
Mənim üçün nə ifadə etdiyini bildiyini sanmıram, həm də heç
Çünki, səninlə mən bir komanda kimi idik, sənin köməkçin idim
Bu lənətə gəlmiş mikrofonu buraxdıqda mənimlə savaşmaq istəyəcəksən
Ya da məni qucaqlayacaqsan, amma seçimlərim çox az
Edə biləcəyim bir şey yoxdur, çünki..

Ağlımı itirmək üzrəyəm
Uzun zamandır yoxsan
Zamanım tükənir
Mənə bir həkim lazım, mənə bir həkim çağırın
Mənə bir həkim lazım, məni həyata geri gətirməsi üçün

Sənin çırpındığını gördükcə üzülürəm; mənə yeni fikirlərlə gəlirsən
""Onlar sadəcə piyada"" deyirsən, başa düşmürəm
Çünki, eşitdiklərim çox mənasız
Amma ya getdikcə tənbəlləşirsən
Ya da artıq özünə inancın qalmadı
Öz fikirlərini belə canlandıra bilmirsən, elə görünür
Qərar verə bilmirsən, özünü günahlandırırsan
Və hardasa mənim köməyim üçün yalvarırsan da
Sanki mən sənin liderinəmmiş kimi, mənim ağıl müəllimim olmalı idin
Artıq dayana bilmirəm, kim olduğunu xatırla
Mənə inanan sən idin
Halbuki hər kəs məni götürməməli olduğunu söylərkən
Şirkətindəki hər kəs, gəl həqiqətlərdən danışaq
Kariyeranı mənim üçün riskə atan sən idin, bunu ikimiz də bilirik
Kimsə ağ birisi ilə əlləşmək istəmədi
Dre, bu kabinetdə ağlayıram
Həyatımı xilas etdin, indi isə xilas etməsi sırası məndə
Amma sənə əsla borcumu ödəyə bilmərəm, etdiklərin hər şeydən önəmli
Amma inanmaqdan əl çəkmirəm, sən də məndən
Oyan Dre, ölürəm, sənə ehtiyacım var, Tanrı xatirinə geri dön!

Ağlımı itirmək üzrəyəm
Uzun zamandır yoxsan
Zamanım tükənir
Mənə bir həkim lazım, mənə bir həkim çağırın
Mənə bir həkim lazım, məni həyata geri gətirməsi üçün

Ciddən bir ömür öncəymiş kimi hiss edirəm
Yenə də xatırlayıram sanki dünən baş verib
Sarı paltarınla gəldin, içəridəki hər kəs lağa qoydu
Sən studioya girənə kimi, mikfrofonu öldür demişdim
Dostlarım oldu, bəziləriylə yola getdik
Amma hamısı getdi, ölənə kimi dost qalacağımızı söyləmişdilər
Bəs indi hansı cəhənnəmdədirlər?
Tam onlara ehtiyacım varkən heç birini görə bilmirəm; tək gördüyüm Slim
Hamınız rədd olun! Yalnız ona ehtiyacım var
Lənətə gəlmiş xainlər
Çətin vəziyyətə düşdüyümüzdə sadəcə izləyib güldünüz
İndi isə Aftermath'ın qəzəbini görəcəksiniz, ibnələr!
Bizi yalnızca işləyərkən görəcəksiniz
Və ""Harada idiniz"" deyə soruşacaqsınız
Götümün qərarsız yanaqlarını öpün, qurdlar, Eminem'iminkiləri də
Pox kimi beatlər və riyaziyyat
Gic prodüsserlər; Mən geri döndüm, piçlər!
Son bir CD daha və sonrasında əşyalarımı toplayıram
Və ayrılarkən də qaranti verirəm ki, qışqıracaqsınız
""Dre, bizi belə qoyma dostum"" çünki..

It's your anniversary isn't it
And your man ain't acting right
So you packin’ your Damier luggage up callin’ my cell phone, try and catch a flight
You know one thing straight, I’ll be there girl whenever you call me
When you at home that's your man, soon as you land you say that's all me
But shit ain't all G with him no more, you ain't entertained
Since I meet you a couple months ago you ain't been the same
Not sayin I’m the richest man alive but I’m in the game
As long as you keep it 100 I'mma spend this change

Whenever you need me
Whenever you want me
You know you can call me, I’ll be there shortly
Don’t care what your friends say, cause they don't know me
I can be your best friend, and you be my homie

Whenever you call baby I roll up, I roll up, I roll up
Whenever you call baby I roll up, I roll up, I roll up

I try to stay out your business
But on the real, you’re so obvious
And if you keep fitting me in your plans and fuckin' up, your man's gonna catch onto us
That white sand surrounding us
He be handcuffing, he should work for them officers
If you rolling I got a spot where I can put you on this medical, and send you home doctored up
You wanna ride with me cause you say that he boring
Wake up you rollin’ weed, cooking eggs in the morning
Ain't scared to spend this money I’ll make more of it
First you was in the sky, now you say you in orbit

Whenever you need me
Whenever you want me
You know you can call me, I’ll be there shortly
Don’t care what your friends say, cause they don't know me
I can be your best friend, and you be my homie

She eat me up, she got expensive taste
I see you dreaming, but you still awake
Big slices, that's how you cut the cake
It's cold as hell, I show and tell
Weezy home, our nigga out of jail!
In this ""give or take"" world I got what it takes
Put you out your misery: Kathy Bates
I'm Young Money, I'm Cash Money
If we could buy time I'd spend my last money
Now I'm spending time, you in the blind
This little light of mine, I'mma let it shine
Bright lights, night lights, headlights, shh
No lights but them infrared lights
Long life, don't like to ask twice
You killing me baby, this the past life

(All of the lights)
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

Ready, set, go, go, go, go, go
Go til you can't go no more
I'm ill times ill, dope plus dope
""Westside bitch,"" quote, unquote
Woah there boy, don't go there ho
If you cross that line I might overload
I swear these lights be talking to me
But I can't read Morse Code
Why every rapper named ""Big"" got bodied, huh?
But every rapper named ""Sean"" got money, ooh?
Well I guess my chances are 50/50
But my vision is 20/20 so I be counting a hundred 100's
Oh my Allah, Lordy lordy lordy, I took your chick
Now you want beef and I am chuckling like I'm Porky
Cause you spend all day with her spooning
I spend all night with her forking
There's a one-way ticket to Hell and
They want these bullets to book it for me
I'm shitting on every statistic that said I'd be dead or fuckin broke
This is history, your kids' kids' kids' kids' kids gonna book report me
And I think they want to murder me
I'm shining hard, because bitch I'm an emergency

(All of the lights)
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

So good, so good, Westside, so hood
I do it.. B. I.... G

Bad decisions, good intentions, man I'm riding, Weezy with me
I just stepped out of the strip club, made 5000 look like 50
I spend all my time in Houston, smoke that kush but I don't do Whitney
I don't do Britney, I don't do Lindsay
I made $2 million since last Wednesday
And I hate y'all! Y'all got too much free time
Saying I don't drop shit, everything gon be fine
Worrying about your old girl, trying to see if she's mine
Nigga she's with me when she tells you she needs some ""me time""
It's our time, so fuck y'all!
I'm really about to go Spring Break now
And start taking shots in this muthafucka
And you didn't have all that ass last month girl
What, you get some shots in this muthafucka?
Yeah, we got the Roc in this muthafucka
You thought niggas going pop in this muthafucka?
Young Money, power, respect in this bitch
You would think we got the LOX in this muthafucka
I made mistakes, I made some bread
I even made a way for them to get ahead
To my surprise, nobody replacing me
Take Care and Carter IV it won't be long 'til they can see the lights
And I'm on one, I got one
You a pussy nigga, I'm not one, so call it a night, call it a night
And I run this, and y'all know that
I take the purple and pour that, all in the Sprite, all in the Sprite"

Ooooh
Jahreszeiten kommen und gehen
Aber ich werde mich nie ändern
Und ich bin unterwegs

Lets go ...
Yeah
Du hörst jetzt zu
Sie sagen, dass sie so etwas lange nicht gehört haben
Das ist der Grund, warum sie mein Lied auf so viele verschiedene Arten spielen
Denn ich wurde öfter geschlagen als ein diszipliniertes Kind
Wenn sie mich sehen flippen alle aus (brrrrraps, brrrrrraps)
Junge, ich bin wie eine neue Pistole und ein voller schwarzer Kasten
Ich vergoß Tränen wegen dem gewaltigen Angriff
Ich habe nur Erfolg, wenn ich mit Krawall und Schlägern arbeite
Schaut meine Jacke und meinen Hut an
So verdammt wütend
So am Boden zerstört
Ich bringe die Schwerkraft zurück
Aufgenommen von Gott will ich meine Familie zurück
Die Leute arbeiten hart, nur um ihren Gehalt zu versteuern
Schaut, ich bin nur ein Schreiber aus dem Ghetto wie Malory Blackman
Wo zur Hölle bleibt die Vernunft, verdammt
Ich war es gewohnt, das Kind zu sein, um das sich niemand kümmert
Deswegen musst du solange schreien bis sie dir zuhören

Oh

Yeah, ich brauchte eine Veränderung
Solange wir aßen, sind wir niemals umgekippt, denn wir brauchten die Veränderung
Ich brauchte eine Auszeit
Für eine Sekunde habe ich sogar aufgehört zu glauben und zu beten
Ich habe sogar legale Sachen gemacht und bin trotzdem in die Verlorenheit geführt worden
Sie sagen Geld ist der Ursprung der schlechtesten Wege
Aber warst du jemals so hungrig, dass du davon wach bliebst?
Mann, mein Hunger würde sie jetzt staunen lassen
Toll, es scheint als müsste ich lange darauf warten, Familie
Seit dem Tag denke ich an den ausgedachten Plan
Eines Tages hatte ich einen Traum und ich versuchte ihm hinterher zu laufen
Aber ich ging nicht ins Nirgendwo, lauf weiter Mann!
Ich wusste, dass ich vielleicht eines Tages alles verstehen würde
Versuche, einen Zehner zu hundert Mille zu wechseln
Jeder ist ein Kind um das sich niemand kümmert
Du musst nur solange schreien bist sie dir zuhören

How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall

And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

All the time"

Pretend I don't live in it
Sunshine going to wash my blues away
Had sweet love but I lost it
She got too close so I fought her
Now I'm lost in the world trying to find me a better way

Wishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze and it don't seem fair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

Wrote a note said be back in a minute
Bought a boat and I sailed off in it
Don't think anybody going to miss me anyway
Mind on a permanent vacation
The ocean is my only medication
Wishing my condition ain't ever going to go away

Now I'm knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

This champagne shore washing over me
It's a sweet sweet life living by the salty sea
One day you could be as lost as me
Change your geography
Maybe you might be

Knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

Come on in the water's nice
Find yourself a little slice
Grab a backpack of lies
You never know until you try
When you lose yourself
You find the key to paradise"

About hearts that you’ve broken and ties that you’ve severed

Standing on the chairs, standing on the bar

From the window to the wall

Is it daylight, or is it nighttime?
One o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, four
We gon' tear the club up, up, up, up, up, up, up

Day-o, me say day-o
Daylight come and we don't wanna go home
Yeah, so we losing control
Turn the lights low 'cause we about to get blown

Burn it down, to the floor, oh, oh, oh

Daylight come and we don't wanna go home (let's go)

I just met this sexy Haitian girl moving like a dancer
Told her and her girlfriends, ""Let's meet in my cabana""
Ask me where the party at, baby, I'm the answer
Have another drink with me, shorty, where your manners?
Take another shot, another shot, shot, shot, shot (haha, oh, yeah)

Changing my mood
A little George Strait 1982
And it makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab my honey
Tear down some two-lane country
Who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take
Makes me wanna take a back road
I've been cooped up, tied down, 'bout forgotten
What a field looks like, full of corn and cotton
If I'm gonna hit a traffic jam
Well it better be a tractor man
So sick and tired of this interstate system
I need a curve and wind-a-twistin'
Dusty path to nowhere
With the wind blowing through my baby's hair
Yeah, makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home

Maybe it's the feeling or maybe it's the freedom
Maybe it's that shady spot
Where we park the truck when the things get hot

Homem coco
Cabeça-de-lua
E Ervilha
Vocês estão prontos?
Parece que todo mundo tem um preço
Eu me pergunto como eles dormem à noite
Quando a venda vem em primeiro
E a verdade vem em segundo
Apenas pare por um minuto e
Sorria
Por que todos estão tão sérios
Agindo tão misteriosamente?
Vocês tem as sombras nos seus olhos
E seus saltos tão altos
Que você não pode nem ter um bom
Momento
Todos olham para suas perdas (sim)
Todos olham para seus direitos (ha)
Você pode sentir isso? (sim)
Bem, pague-os com amor esta noite
Não se trata de dinheiro, dinheiro, dinheiro
Nós não precisamos do seu dinheiro, dinheiro, dinheiro
Nós só queremos fazer o mundo dançar
Esqueça a etiqueta de preço
Não se trata de din-din
Não se trata de joias brilhando
Nós só queremos fazer o mundo dançar
Esqueça a etiqueta de preço
Precisamos voltar no tempo
Quando a música deixava todos nós unidos
Não tinha golpes baixos e vadias em videos
Sou a única ficando cansada?
Por que todos estão tão obcecados?
O dinheiro não pode nos comprar felicidade
Se todos nós ralaxarmos e nos divertirmos agora
Garanto que nos sentiremos
Muito bem
Todos olham para suas perdas (sim)
Todos olham para seus direitos (ha)
Você pode sentir isso? (sim)
Bem, pague-os com amor esta noite
Não se trata de dinheiro, dinheiro, dinheiro
Nós não precisamos do seu dinheiro, dinheiro, dinheiro
Nós só queremos fazer o mundo dançar
Esqueça a etiqueta de preço
Não se trata de din-din
Não se trata de joias brilhando
Nós só queremos fazer o mundo dançar
Esqueça a etiqueta de preço
Sim, sim
Mantenha a etiqueta do preço
E pegue o dinheiro de volta
Só me dê seis cordas e um amplificador
E você pode ficar com os carros
Deixe a garagem pra mim
E tudo o que eu
Sim, tudo que preciso são teclas e violões
E adivinha, em 30 segundos estou indo pra Marte
Sim, iremos contra estas probabilidades inderrotáveis
É assim cara, você não pode colocar um preço na minha vida
Fazemos isso por amor
Então lutamos e nos sacrificamos toda noite
Então não vamos tropeçar e cair jamais, não
Esperando para ver um sinal de derrota uh, uh
Então nós vamos fazer todos mexerem os pés
Então, traga a batida de volta e todos cantam

God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you

There's more here than what we’re seeing
A divine conspiracy
That you, an angel lovely
Could somehow fall for me
You'll always be love's great martyr
And I'll be the flattered fool
And I need you
Yeah!

God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you

On my own I'm only
Half of what I could be
I can't do without you
We are stitched together
And what love has tethered
I pray we never undo

Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you, gave me you
He gave me you"

You ain't nothing but a vulture
Always hopin' for the worst
Waiting for me to fuck up
You’ll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean
When I tell her keep it drama free
Chuckin up them (deuces)
I told you that I'm leaving (deuces)
I know you're mad, but so what
I wish you best of luck
And now I'm finna throw them deuces up

What you mean I ain’t call you? I hit you when I landed
I’m waiting in my hotel room
Seems like we're arguing more and it’s getting less romantic
Yeah, I think she’ll be able to tell soon
But I'll fuck you right, I will, I fuck you right, I will
I’ll fuck you like no one has ever, ever made you feel
I mean this part of our relationship's amazing still
I might just put up with the arguing and stay, for real
You looking bad, girl for goodness sakes
You with all those curves, and me without no brakes, ooh
I’m willing to work it out however long it takes you
You feel like you miss those happy days well girl that makes two of us
Our timing is wrong
Your friends always tying up every line on your phone
Yeah but tell them bitches that you’ll always be my missus
And the hardest part about the fucking business is minding your own
And every time I try and break it off
We just yell until we tired then I break you off
It’s useless all this fighting let's get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces, you just send it back around

Your wrist and fingers glisten; ice cold like Michigan
Look at what we livin' in, here we go with this again
I just keep on talking but I guess that you ain't listening
Rather run around with them nothing ass bitches then
Go on, got me hot, smoking like a chimney
We used to be best friends, now it seems we finna be enemies
Deep inside it’s killing me, but soon its gon' be killing you
To see her in that two seater, now that's gon' hurt your feelings, boo
Ah ha, didn’t you think you would be over me
By now so you go sleeping with them clowns, they are no relief
She spoke her piece, I know, capisce
So love must be let go, released
Into the wind, again, again. and deuces I must throw ya peace

You know what, yo? You a bitch
You should have a travel agent, cause you a trip
You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit
But all you got is some fucking issues you fucking bitch
I hate niggas, but I love your mom
Give her a kiss for me, her second son
Get your mind right baby or get your shit together
You gonna be hot a little while, I’mma be rich forever
Girl seducers, they come in deuces
But when I cut 'em off they always become a nuisance
Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch and turn it to his new bitch
I’m stupid but I won’t get my drama on
What I’m dealing with is too real for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
So when you talk 'bout “you know who” I don’t know who you talking 'bout

According to my old bitch I be on some new shit
She was on some old shit, now I got a new bitch
Think I give two shits? you ain't gonna do shit
Meet my two fingers, intro-deuces
If you knew better you’d do better
Wanna get the middle finger, but I got two better

So you gonna diss me even though you know it’s wrong
Know you gonna

(miss me a little when I’m gone)

Drizzy voice, now I’m ghost baby
Four door Rizzy Royce
Tryna work it out might be a bad business choice
I’m bout my business boys, plus I make paper
Come on that's old news, yesterday’s paper
Oh, you talking, what about?
If it ain't how I kept you studded out
You might as well shut ya mouth
You’ll never score another me, I’ll shut it out
Act like there’s gum in your hair girl, cut it out

Got a pocket full of hundreds
She the only one is missing
Got a bucket full of ice, and a watch to go with it
Got a racing Lamborghini have my homies scared to drive
Haters better put their head down they know that boy be fly
All the charter planes, now I’m talking ballers slang
R.O.Z.A.Y. on that wall in the hall of fame
I let my denim sag #red Louis belt
How can you love me baby, first you gotta love yourself

The farewell email from a female
But I’m a playa, ain't gonna tell you all the details
What it entails is hard to say like selling seashells
By the seashore, but she’s not a bore
But neither a whore who needs to know more
The kind you can’t ignore but want to open the door for
Or run in your favorite store and leave with all them shopping bags and half of it ain't yours
I did things for, ain't rich ain't poor
I want it to do more but hell I just ain't know her
Well enough to know if this is all she came for
But enough to know tonight excited she came four
Times to my cousins house to see if I was there
Get ya minds out the gutter man
We out here tryna have a good time
And here I am, all heavy with the words where
Somebody that's a nerd, likely fast forward
But shit they asked for it
It’s hard to throw up them deuces cause when you know it’s juicy
You start to sound like Confucius when making up excuses
Chase the Cabooses until the track gone
I gotta find me a new locomotive, stop making sad songs

I'm on some new shit
I'm chucking my deuces up to her
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more trying to make it work
You made me wanna say bye bye, say bye bye, say bye bye to her; to her"

Talking 'bout everything under the moon
With the smell of honeysuckle and your perfume
All I could think about was my next move

Oh but you were so shy, so was I
Maybe that's why it was so hard to believe
When you smiled and said to me

Are you gonna kiss me or not?
Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I like you a lot
But you're about to miss your shot
Are you gonna kiss me or what?

It was the best dang kiss that I ever had
Except for that long one after that
And I knew if I wanted this thing to last
Sooner or later I'd have to ask for your hand

So I took a chance
Bought a wedding band and I got down on one knee
And you smiled and said to me

Are you gonna kiss me or not?
Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I love you a lot
I think we've got a real good shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

So we planned it all out for the middle of June
From the wedding cake to the honeymoon
And your momma cried
When you walked down the aisle

When the preacher man said, ""Say I do""
I did and you did too
Then I lifted that veil
And saw your pretty smile and I said
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

Are we gonna do this or what?
Look at all the love that we got
It ain't never gonna stop
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

Yeah baby I love you a lot
I really think we've got a shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not?"

The bitter taste the morning left
Swore I wouldn't go back there again

At first sight and it's real

All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be...
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If ""Happy Ever Afters"" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I've said it before
But all of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
Now I'm at a payphone

Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money
While you're sitting round wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me I'm stunting
And all of my cars start with a push of a button
Telling me the chances I blew up
Or whatever you call it
Switch the number to my phone
So you never could call it
Don't need my name on my show
You can tell it I'm ballin
Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could have saw but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up valet open doors
Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want, so you can go and take
That little piece of shit with you
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If ""Happy Ever Afters"" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit

Losing it all on my own

And I'm not keeping up

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone

Noises, I play within my head
Touch my own skin
And hope that I'm still breathing
And I think back to when
My brother and my sister slept
In an unlocked place
The only time I feel safe

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone

My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

Sometimes, I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died

Some nights, I call it a draw
Some nights, I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights, I wish they'd just fall off
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
What do I stand for?
What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know anymore

This is it, boys, this is war
What are we waiting for?
Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype
Save that for the black and white
Try twice as hard and I'm half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style

And that's alright
(That's Alright)
I found a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering
Just who I, who, I, who I am
Oh, who am I?

Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again

Washed my hands of that for this?

When I hear songs, they sound like a swan
So, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on

Well, that is it, guys, that is all
Five minutes in and I'm bored again
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks back home
Sorry to leave, Mom, I had to go
Who the fuck wants to die alone
All dried up in the desert sun?

My heart is breaking for my sister
And the con that she called ""love""
And then I look into my nephew's eyes
Man, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things
That can come from
Some terrible nights

The other night, you wouldn't believe
The dream I just had about you and me
I called you up, but we'd both agree

There's only one Flo and one Rida
I'm a damn shame, order more champagne
Pulling them hamstrings, tryna put it on ya
Bet your lips spin back around corner
Slow it down, baby, take a little longer

Can you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Let me know
Girl, I'm gonna show you how to do it and we start real slow
You just put your lips together and you come real close
Can you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Here we go

Whistle, baby, whistle, baby
Whist-whistle, baby, whistle, baby
Whistle, baby, whistle, baby
Whist-whistle, baby, whistle, baby

It's like everywhere I go, my whistle ready to blow
Shawty don't even know, she can get any for the low
Told me she's not a pro, it's okay, it's under control
Show me soprano 'cause, girl, you can handle
Baby, we'll start slow then you come up and park close
Girl, I'm the whistle man, my Bugatti the same notes
Show me your perfect pitch, you got it, my banjo
Talented with your lips like you blew out a candle
So amusing
Now you can make a whistle with the music
Hope you ain't got no issues, you can do it
Even if it's no picture, never lose it

Can you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Let me know
Girl, I'm gonna show you how to do it and we start real slow
You just put your lips together and you come real close
Can you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Here we go

Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true
Cause you moved to west L.A. or New York or Santa Fe

Oh but that one night
Was more than just right
I didn't leave you cause I was all through
Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love

My love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile you drove away

So let's skip the ""How you been?""
And get down to the ""more than friends"" at last

I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
We know, they won't get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all on the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste
Pushing me away so I give her space
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
When the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry, you won't ever have to hide
If you've seen all my mistakes so look me in my eyes


It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you don't say you love me to your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do .. You do
One time been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, so don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
We know you hate being alone and you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you something
To save you .. instead they say:

Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true"

I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding
If that'll make it right

'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same if you walk away
Everyday, it will rain
Rain, rain"

And sweaty palms from hanging on too tight
Clenched shut jaw
I've got another headache again tonight
Eyes on fire, eyes on fire
And they burn from all the tears
I've been crying, I've been crying
I've been dying over you
Tie a knot in the rope
Tryna hold, tryna to hold
But there's nothing to grasp so
I let go

I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

I won't miss
All of the fighting that we always did
Take it in
I mean what I say when I say there is nothing left
No more sick
Whiskey dick
No more battles for me
You'll be calling a trick
Cause you no longer sleep
I'll dress nice
I'll look good
I'll go dancing alone
I will laugh
I'll get drunk
I'll take somebody home

I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss

Blow me one last kiss
Blow me one last kiss

I will do what I please
Anything that I want
I will breathe
I will breathe
I won't worry at all
You will pay for your sins
You'll be sorry, my dear
All the lies, all the ""why's"" will be crystal clear

I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us

We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

But in another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

The one
The one
The one
The one that got away

All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, whoa
'Cause now I pay the price

In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

The one (The one)
The one (The one)
The one (The one)
In another life, I would make you stay

Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too

""I'll remember,"" you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

I don't know where you're going
Or when you're coming home

I don't know where you're going (Let's go, yeah)
Just get your ass back home

We both knew this type of life didn't come with instructions (No)
So I'm trying to do my best to make something out of nothing
And sometimes it gets down right shitty in fact
When you call and I don't even know what city I'm at
Or what day of the week in the middle of the month
In a year I don't recall
It's like my life's on repeat and the last time we spoke I told you I wouldn't be long
That was last November now December's almost gone
I'd apologize, but I don't realize what I'm doing wrong
I never know

I don't know where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door (That's love, yeah)
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know where you're going (Uh-huh, ok, what's that?)
Just get your ass back home

And you've been nothing but amazing and I'll never take that for granted
Half of these birds would've flew the coop but you, you truly understand it
And the fact you stood beside me every time you heard some bogusness (Tough love)
You deserve a standing O cause they'd have just been over it
Let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk
Like we don't hear what they saying
Let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk
We'll just drive by and keep waving
'Cause you and I above all that, just let 'em wallow in it
And now they all choked up, yuck - 'cause they be swallowin' it

I don't know where you're going (Yeah)
Or when you're coming home (Alright)
I left the keys under the mat (I'm coming home, mama)
(Mama, I'm coming home)
To our front door (That's love)
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know where you're going (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Just get your ass back home

No one holds me down like you do sweetheart
You keep doing that, I'll keep doing this
And we'll be alright, trust that
We put the ""us"" in ""trust"", baby
Ahh, let's go!

I don't care what you're after
As long as I'm the one, no
I don't care why you're leaving
You'll miss me when you're gone

I don't know where you're going (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Or when you're coming home (Ok)
I left the keys under the mat (I'm home now, baby, let's go)

I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut-off jeans
Somewhere between that setting sun
I'm on Fire and Born to Run
You looked at me and I was done
And we're, we're just getting started

I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang
Oohh
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin' don't go

When I think about you, I think about 17
I think about my old jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen

I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name I bet there'd still be a spark
Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm

Baby, is it spring or is it summer?
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear Born in the USA
You relive those glory days
So long ago

When you think about me, do you think about 17
Do you think about my old jeep
Think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night

To see your beautiful face anymore
I stare at a picture of you and listen to the radio
Hope, hope there's a conversation
We both admit we had it good
But until then it's alienation, I know
That much is understood
And I realize

If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say I'm  not over you
(not over you)

Damn, damn girl you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell
But still you're magnificent
I I'm a boomerang, doesn't matter how you throw me
I turn around and I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me
But I'm not even close without you

If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say I'm not over you

And if I had the chance to renew
You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do
I could get back on the right track
But only if you'd be convinced
So until then...

If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind

Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops? (Turn it up)
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop (Peace)
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like on the interstate (Never know)

I think I finally found a note to make you understand

Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then

Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

She like them boys with the big ol' chains
Ridin' around town in a big ol' Range
I knew her when I rocked big ol' jeans
Now the little nigga doin' big ol' thangs
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to ya, like you asked for it
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: “Baby girl, come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there.”
And I brag hardly, but just to show up at this party
I made what yo' nigga make in one year
That's unfair, but so is life, take a chance, roll the dice
Money can’t buy you love, 'cause it’s overpriced
Don’t overthink, just hope it's right
I’m only here for the night

Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing

Carolina Blue kicks, fresh on the scene
Hottest nigga on the block
Damn, girl, you're mean
They be startin' shit, but it’s yo' world
On my Martin shit: “You go, girl!”
She bad and she know it
Some niggas save hoes, I’m not that heroic
Could you be my escort?
'Cause just like them two door Fords
Damn, they don’t make 'em like you no more
Cole World, real Cole World
Them boys cool—me, I’m on fire
Know what's on my mind
Tryna see what's on yours tonight, tonight, tonight
Move slow, 'cause you wanna live fast
Up late so you'll probably skip class
Life is a test so before the night pass, get right, get right

Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am

Go ahead and sell me out, and then I'll lay your ship  bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you
Now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared

(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
I can't help feeling

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door (oh-oh)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (whoa-oh)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (oh-oh)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
It all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Talking to myself, anything to make a sound

H-Town so I'm made for lean
I'm in her soul, I make her scream
I don't ride the toll, don't pay the change
I'm EZ tag like Peter Pan
She want a man, don't need a man
I'm flying down your boulevard
She cookin' dinner with your pans
Draped up, dripped out
Your bitch know what I'm taking 'bout
Pulls up, pull out
We get it poppin' in the parking lot
She like to do it with the lights on
Don't matter to me if it's dark or not
I'm G'd up, East up
Fossil pants, I'm hard as rock

Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that don't really need you
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that ain't trying to keep
You heard what I said, that could put you to bed
That ain't tryin' to love you baby, just fuck you instead
And don't tell 'em nothing baby, you know that I'm comin' baby
Just hit up my phone whenever you need you some company
Got this drank in my cup, oh yeah
I got this drank in my cup
I got this drank in my cup, cup, cup

I done came down, came up
Slow pitch, change up
Same hood, same style, same drink, same cup
She call me when she wanna fuck
I never call, she knows what's up
Same page, same book, different song, same hook
Everytime her nigga trippin', she on the phone with the same crook
And everytime I pull up, she hit me with that same look
Lips bitin', hips right
She left her man for that get right
I'm in the middle, like midnight
Only if you got that sit tight
Only if you got that wine fine
Only if you got that sip type
Only if you got that mind bomb
Only if you got that zip tight
Eat that shit like wonton
Jokin' baby, I'm pimp tight
I'm used to bein' that one and done
But girl you got that g-get right

In the middle of Paris with a Dominican broad
Great head on her shoulders, she probably studied abroad
She transferred to Harvard from King's College in March
She says that I'm her favorite 'cause she admires the art
Michelangelo with the flow, Picasso with the bars
She's well put together like a piece by Gershwin
Renaissance style, tonight is picture perfect, so smile
And pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush just take it slow
You'll be in the high life, soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You say you never had it so good

La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la

Suffering from first class cabin fever
Five hour layovers from Norway to Egypt
I'm to the point like the pyramids of Giza
Still I'm to the left like the tower out in Pisa
I'm feeling single baby, I could use a feature
Swagger like Caesar, I'll get you a visa
We can go to Italy and maybe see the Colosseum
I'll be Da Vinci if you'll be my Mona Lisa, now smile
So pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy oh

Well I been feeling singular, how 'bout let's make it plural
Spin the globe, wherever it lands that's where we'll go
We'll hit up Europe, yep, and spend some Euros
And maybe visit Berlin, the walls with the murals
This is your month baby, sign of the Virgo
Private reservations, glasses full of Merlot
A Rosé, a Burgundy, traveling like turbo
Brush up on your Español, we're Barcelona-bound, so smile
So pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

That it's not you, it's me
You're leaving now for my own good
That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say

She went down in an airplane
Fried getting suntanned
Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!
She met a shark under water
Fell and no one caught her
I returned everything I ever bought her
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died

My pride still feels the sting
You were my everything
Some day I'll find a love like yours (a love like yours)
She'll think I'm Superman
Not super minivan
How could you leave on Yom Kippur?
That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say

She was caught in a mudslide
Eaten by a lion
Got run over by a crappy purple Scion
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!

Drowned in a hot tub
Danced to death at an east side night club

Now, red Solo cup is the best receptacle
For barbecues, tailgates, fairs, and festivals
And you, sir, do not have a pair of testicles
If you prefer drinking from glass
Hey, red Solo cup is cheap and disposable
And in 14 years, they are decomposable
And unlike my home, they are not foreclosable
Freddy Mac can kiss my ass

Now, I really love how you're easy to stack
But I really hate how you're easy to crack
'Cause when beer runs down in front of my pack
Well, that, my friends, is quite yucky
But I have to admit that the ladies get smitten
Admiring at how sharply my first name is written
On you with a Sharpie when I get to hitting
On them to help me get lucky

'Cause you are the Abbott to my Costello
And you are the Fruit to my Loom

You're more than amazing, you're more than fantastic
And believe me that I am not the least bit sarcastic

Colors and promises
How to be brave?
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow
One step closer

I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath
Every hour has come to this
One step closer

I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

One step closer

To your place around eight o'clock

I hope you are wearing those frayed out cut-offs
Makes me want to get lost out in the moonlight

When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit

Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check

I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

So this is where you fell
And I am left to sail
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check

I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit

That I'm never changing who I am
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes, to ashes

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit

Now don't you understand

But your pretty little eyes so blue
Are pulling me in
Like the moon on your skin
I’m so glad you trusted me
To slide up on this dusty seat
And let your hair down
Get out of town

Got the stars coming out over my hood
And all I know now is it's going good

You got your hands up
You’re rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You’re singing every song
I’m set on cruise control
I’m slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You’re looking so damn hot

And I don’t know what road we’re on
Or where we’ve been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I don’t want this night to end

Going to cuss the morning when it comes
'Cause I know that the rising sun
Ain’t no good for me
'Cause you’ll have to leave
Going to make the most of every mile
Do anything to make your smile
Land on my lips
Get drunk on your kiss

Clock on the dash says 3:35
There’s plenty of gas and the night’s still alive

You got your hands up
You’re rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You’re singing every song
I’m set on cruise control
I’m slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You’re looking so damn hot

Had a bitch, but she ain't bad as you
So, hit me up when you pass through
I'll give you something big enough to tear your ass in two

In a hundred years not dare would I
Pull a Pharcyde, let you pass me by
Nothin' like your last guy, he too square for you
He don't smack that ass and pull your hair like that
So I'm just watching and waitin'
For you to salute the true big pimpin'
Not many women can refuse this pimping
I'm a nice guy, but don't get confused, this pimpin'

Parallel on the other side

I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the past
I'm here tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong

I don't wanna lose you now

The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy

Aren't you somethin', an original?
'Cause it doesn't seem merely assembled
And I can't help but stare, 'cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I
Would look at us all the time

That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made (oh)
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes

So says country superstar duo Florida Georgia Line in their smash single from the spring of 2014, “This Is How We Roll.”  This is not just an empty boast, either.  Listen to the second verse while imagining Drake as a white, Southern, bro-country artist:
""Up on them 37 Nittos, windows tinted hard to see though 
Them kisses are for me though, automatic like a free throw
This life I live it might not be for you, but it's for me though""
Not only is the rhetoric Drake worthy – extolling the virtues of a uniquely superior lifestyle - but the way he rhymes “though” using a slang pronunciation three times in close succession, why, it even sounds like Drake!
On another track, their “Cruise Remix” video featuring Nelly, Florida Georgia Line also supply imagery indicative of their genre-blending.  While some rap music has long been accused of focusing on cash, cars, drugs, and women, FGL show that this is redneck thematic territory as well; just observe the expensive rides and seductively southern dames:
Likewise, through artful alliteration, the boys name-drop their party drink as well:
""She was sippin' on Southern and singin' Marshall Tucker""
And this is all before we get to Nelly’s impassioned verse, which he contributes, according to the video’s opening scene, to help them learn how to “turn up.”  Judging by “This Is How We Roll” as a follow-up, it is obvious FGL have learned the lesson well –- so well that they have been influenced even by the structure of Hip-Hop, bringing in one of their homies for a guest verse: Luke Bryan, himself known to get turnt by mixing a little Conway with some T-Pain every once in a while
Some people, though, are instead turning this trend down. While peeping their video on YouTube reveals over 16 million views (as of 7/17/14), the comments section is filled with vitriolic rants.  One such comment puts it this way: “Hick-Hop. Manufactured, lame, corporate horse crap. This is a disgrace to country music. Johnny Cash is rolling over in his grave right now.”
Really?
The same Johnny Cash who was the OG Southern thug!  The same Johnny Cash who put so much conviction into singing lines like:
""I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down""
""When I was arrested I was dressed in black""
""I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die""
We’re talking the “Man In Black” himself!
I think he’d welcome the chance, were he still alive, to pal around with some new school gangsters, and, presented with an opportunity for a remix, would probably choose to turn up instead of turn it down!"

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way

It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take it's given
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know


The reason I hold on
Cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
Cause when you never see the light
It's hard to know which one of us is caving

Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost

And I didn't know ﻿I was lost


I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
I wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
And love is the prize

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost

Y'all sit back and enjoy the light show
Nothing exceeds like excess
Stoute got gout from having the best of the best
Is this what it's all about? I'm at the rest-
...aurant with my rant disturbing the guests
Years of distress, tears on the dress
Try to hide her face with some makeup sex
This is truffle season
Tom Ford tuxedos for no reason
All Saints for my angel
Alexander Wang too
Ass-tight Denim and some Dunks
I'll show you how to do this young!
No papers, catch vapors
Get high, out Vegas
D'usses on doubles, ain't looking for trouble
You just got good genes so a nigga tryna cuff you
Tell your mother that I love her cause I love you
Tell your father we go farther as a couple
They ain't lose a daughter, got a son
I show you how to do this, huh!

Well… Lil Wayne has a new single, and it’s called “Love Me”. Well, with a title like that, I don’t know what to expect. However, after “How to Love” turned out to be an awkward but slightly admirable ballad about a girl going through a hard life, maybe a song titled “Love Me” would be a more personal number. Contemplating his personal struggles with trust and relationships. And yeah, it could just be another crappy bragging song, but I like to be optimistic when I go into a review. So... what? That’s not the full title of the song? What’s the full title of the song?
Drake: Bitches love me
Man, I feel stupid. Well, let’s get this over with
Future: I’m on that good kush and alcohol
-stupid, unnecessary audio watermark for the producer-
*sneers*
I don’t know what I was doing-
Wait. What was that thing she’s wearing? Is that a stylized version of a scolds bridle? A mild torture device that men put on women in the middle ages when they felt they were talking too much? Wow, we’ve wasted no time into getting into some pretty dark territory, haven’t we? I mean… you know what, I haven’t even started talking about the lyrics yet. I’m just gonna let this one go
Okay, so this song, which sounds more like a mockingbird type lullaby than a club hit, is about being drunk and high and calling a couple girls to have sex. And…maybe these girls are just into really kinky stuff! Like, you know, headgear to remind them of a time when women were seen as even less inferior than we treat them now. Or swing sets. Yeah…
Future: Imma ball ‘til the day I fall
One more thing before we continue. When did this Future character here, a guy who barely passes as a rapper, let alone a singer, become credible enough in the industry to be featured chorus guy? I mean, according to what I’m seeing on the lyric sheet, he has no verse! So without his own full verse, the only appeal to having him on the song is purely based off of his ability to carry a hook. And I’m not sure if you’ve noticed, but…
(shows a cover of the single for “Loveeee Song” by Future and Rihanna as that song plays)
Future isn’t exactly a powerhouse vocalist. I mean, could Lil Wayne honestly not be bothered to do the auto tune on his own hooks? Aren’t you still friends with T-Pain? At least that guy has some personality, this guy is… huh. Funny that a guy named Future is relying on a vocal effect that’s near extinction. I mean, when even T-Pain says...
T-Pain: Auto tune is on its way out!
Back in 2008, I think it’s over as a gimmick that people can take seriously. But back to the song
Drake: Long as my bitches love, my bitches love
Wait, now Drake is on the chorus? Is this the Drake and Future collaboration the world was waiting for? He doesn’t have a verse either, so I can only assume that there was a large enough audience out there that would be oh so content enough to hear the musical style blending off the rapping personifications of both boring and uninteresting. But forgive me again, we need to get back to the song
Drake: I can give a fuck ‘bout no hater
Long as my bitches love me
So the song is about how he doesn’t care how many people dislike him as long as there are women willing to have sex with him. Which is typical, but for some reason, in this song he’s more like an ineffective defense mechanism than cocky, confident braggadocio. Actually listen to the song without the arrogant, too cool to care faces in the music video. And really listen to their voices:
Future: I’m on that good kush and alcohol
I got some down bitches I can call
Is there anything in his voice that indicates that he is in any way happy about his life of excess? I mean, if this was one of those songs where they were trying to make a statement about how empty that kind of life is, that would be perfect, but it’s not. And usually, failings in the vocal melody can be excused by a beat that’s full of vigor and 808, but he can’t do that here, since every time the chorus comes in the beat gets that same muffled and muted effect that’s present on nearly every friggin’ song featuring Drake, and since the vocalists are all you have to go on when this happens, their lifeless delivery stops the song dead!
Drake: I can give a fuck ‘bout no hater
Long as my bitches love me
Does he actually sound convinced here? Does he legitimately sound like he doesn’t care about haters? I don’t know about you guys, but to me it sounds like he’s reverting to irrelevant boasting about superficial accomplishments intended to shield his ego after reading a scathing review of his music that sincerely struck a nerve. All I hear is a couple of insecure men masking their weaknesses with boasts of sexual prowess! And we haven’t even gotten to the verses yet!
Lil Wayne: Pussy ass niggas, stop hating
So, you don’t care about haters in any way, shape or form, and only care about your women... but the first thing you do in your verse is address the haters. Because you know, what better way to show that you don’t care about someone than by constantly mentioning them?
(montage of Wayne mentioning haters throughout the song)
I don’t know about you, but there’s something slightly contradictory about shouting, “HEY, ALL YOU HATERS! PAY ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT I DON’T CARE ABOUT YOU!”
Lil Wayne: Lil Tunechi got that fire
And these hoes love me like Satan, man!
D-do hoes like Satan? I mean, I know hoes are known for having questionable morality, but I don’t think anyone actively likes Satan. I don’t even think Satanists likes Satan, they just do it to piss off Christians. I mean I know you’re trying to relate the Satan and fire thing, but hoes don’t like fire either!
Lil Wayne: And these hoes love me like Satan, man!
You know, believe it or not, but some people think that this little snippet is proof positive that Lil Wayne is part of some demonic cult. And honestly, if you think some post-production CGI inspired by a barely thought out lyric is the proof you need to think Lil Wayne works for the devil... then he does work for the devil... and he’s going to kill you
Lil Wayne: Fuck with me and get bodied
And all she eat is dick, she’s on a strict diet
You don’t know how segways work, do you? I mean, what thought process takes you from “I’m going to kill you!” to “This chick is all about my penis.” For real! The only piece of transitional material we get is the word “and”. And I don’t know about you, but linking two phrases together with the word “and” is not the same as a transitional phrase, and I like nipples
Lil Wayne: She don’t want money
She wants the time we could spend
Pfft. Yeah, okay. Lose all your money to tax evasion and see if all your bitches still want to spend time with you!
Lil Wayne: She said, “I never wanna make you mad
I just wanna make you proud”
I said, “Baby just make me cum
Then don’t make a sound”
Okay… I’m, I’m trying to explain what’s wrong with these lines, and what disturbs me about them. Because it’s not just about the fact that they’re objectifying the girl in question. No, that’s to be expected with Wayne. But it’s the fact that this couplet communicates something more unsettling than that. And I just want to play these lyrics again and ask you a question:
Lil Wayne: She said, “I never wanna make you mad
I just wanna make you proud”
I said, “Baby just make me cum
Then don’t make a sound”
In what way does this NOT sound like an abusive relationship? In what way is this not a controlling sociopath dominating over a woman who’s afraid of giving him any excuse to lash out in anger at her? I mean it’s not overtly stating it, but it’s definitely implied. (sees a shot of a woman in the scolds bridle) Wow. That is not helping. But anyway, in his episode of Behind the Music, he talked about how he freestyles everything because it feels more real to him, and that everything he says honestly speaks to how his mind works because of that. If this is true, it says very disturbing things about him that he considers this as an honest expression of himself. And you know what? He’s an artist, and an artist telling you about his perspective doesn't always have to be a positive thing
But my problem lies not in his questionable morals…well actually yes it does, but it’s the fact that after so many girls hear his music and hear this song in particular, plenty of his female fans are still willing to be his groupies in late night booty calls! I mean, he’s making no bones about the fact that he doesn’t respect you, so at this point, if you’re still trying to get with him, your motivations are probably no better than his, and I think you know what I mean when I talk about the motivations of these types of women. You know, those women, always wanting to spend all of your time…
Lil Wayne: She wants the time we could spend
*scoff* Heartless succubus. But hey, maybe he’s not that bad. Maybe when he’s with these women, he’s actually respectful of the... I’m sorry, are there women in cages like circus animals? So…let me get this straight. Lupe Fiasco makes a song that barely charts, talking about how women should not be purely viewed as sex objects, and should hold themselves to a higher standard, and he’s accused of still bringing up patriarchal views on sexuality and all that stuff. But Lil Wayne has a top 10 hit with a music video where women are viewed as beasts in circus cages?! With lines like...
Lil Wayne: I said, “Baby just make me cum
Then don’t make a sound”
And… nobody’s making a stink about this! I’m not saying it should be pulled off the air or anything, I just think it’s odd that a video with good intentions got crapped on, while a video that can be easily interpreted as equating female sexuality with being entertained by animals is okay. But where was I? Oh, yes. So like I was saying, I’m sure in real life, Wayne is very respectful to women…
Lil Wayne: These hoes got pussies like craters
Damn! That…that imagery! Again, to all the women still wanting to have sex with Lil Wayne: THIS is what he metaphorically thinks of your vaginas! *picture of a crater* So…I think he’s really trying to get across the point that he thinks you’re all whores!
Lil Wayne: Can’t treat these hoes like ladies, man!
Hey…who do you treat like a lady? Because by acknowledging the idea of lady, you’re acknowledging that women can achieve a respectable status. But none of the girls you’ve ever met have achieved that status in your head. So it’s not that you’re saying that all women are whores; you’re just saying that all women you refer to are whores. Hmm... I wonder how that works for other things
""I’m not saying that all Chinese people are good at math, play piano and know Kung Fu, I’m just saying that all the Chinese people I’m ever going to refer to are good at math, play piano and know Kung-where’s everybody going?""
Lil Wayne: Pussy, money, weed, codeine
Was that a lyric, or just a reminder of all the topics he has to stick to?
Lil Wayne: She wake up, eat this dick
Call that breakfast in bed: 69, 96
Wait. What do those last numbers have to do with anything? Are you saying that you and her are 69’ing each other? Well that doesn’t work, since you only mention that she’s going down on you! And what is 96 supposed to mean?! Do you know why it’s called 69, Wayne? Because the numbers vaguely resemble two people orally stimulating each other. So what is 96 supposed to represent? Two people…facing away from each other? What, are they lying on each other’s butts? That makes no sense!
Lil Wayne: I feel her heartbeat
It’s a little late to get romantic, don’t you think?
Lil Wayne: I chest to chest with this bitch
Yeah, I thought so
Lil Wayne: Yeah, all my bitches love me, and I love all my bitches
But it’s like as soon as I cum, I come to my senses
Hold on a minute, maybe the song’s trying to say something. Maybe this whole song is just trying to communicate that meaningless sex with random women doesn’t actually lead to a fulfilling life. And maybe eating less is a good way to get fiber in your diet! Of course there’s no real revelation, he just continues to talk about haters and hoes
Lil Wayne: Now kiss my ass if you hatin
I’m getting ass or I’m skating
Anything that keeps you from playing the guitar. *shows a scene of Wayne playing the guitar live* Yeah, keep hitting those two notes, buddy. I’m sure the people who play the Beginner mode on Guitar Hero are impressed
Yeah, overall, this gets a 0 out of 5 from me. The melancholy beat sounds too dark to be a club song, which is partially what ruins the atmosphere of it. And the chorus fails to do anything that makes up for the dark tone of the beat! And his rhymes are terrible. There’s no wordplay here that’s clever enough to save him from being this unbearably sexist. It crosses the line of being a regular sex anthem into a grotesque assertion of male dominance. And ultimately, does not make for a good listening experience
And that’s pretty much all I have to say about that. Well, I’m the Rap Critic. You don’t have to like my opinion, but I don’t have to like your song

Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
And besides in the mean-meantime I'm just dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the de-details with the devil
So now the world can never get me on my level
I just got to get you out of the cage
I'm a young lovers rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite

My songs know what you did in the dark

So light em up, up, up

Light em up, up, up
I'm on fire
So light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
I'm on fire
In the dark, dark
In the dark, dark

The writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just dies
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything except for me
A constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love
Then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides
My childhood spat back out the monster that you see

My songs know what you did in the dark

So light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up

‘Cause I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, ""Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K!""
Trippin', yeah I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like, ""Yeah, I'm good at little league.""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And ""God loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know

And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
""Man, that's gay"" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
""Gay"" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was at church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it


And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

We press play, don't press pause: progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
Kids are walking 'round the hallway
Plagued by a pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up!

And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

It isn't easy for me to let it go
'Cause I've swallowed every single word
And every whisper, every sigh
Eats away at this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now

So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love

And it's not enough to tell me that you care
When we both know the words are empty air
You give me nothing
Nothing

That I'm never changing who I am

So this is where you fell
And I am left to sail
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check

I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town

That I'm never changing who I am

This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes, to ashes

It's time to begin, isn't it?

Hotter than a fantasy, lonely like a highway
She's living in a world, and it's on fire
Feeling the catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away

Oh, she got both feet on the ground
And she's burning it down
Oh, she got her head in the clouds
And she's not backing down

This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire

Looks like a girl, but she's a flame
So bright, she can burn your eyes
Better look the other way
You can try, but you'll never forget her name
She's on top of the world
Hottest of the hottest girls say

Oh, we got our feet on the ground
And we're burning it down
Oh, got our head in the clouds
And we're not coming down

This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire

Everybody stands, as she goes by
'Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes
Watch her when she's lighting up the night
Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl
And it's a lonely world
But she gon' let it burn, baby, burn, baby

This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire

'Cause I don’t wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I’d have a heart attack

Never put my love out on the line
Never said ""yes"" to the right guy
Never had trouble getting what I want
But when it comes to you, I’m never good enough
When I don’t care, I can play ‘em like a Ken doll
Won’t wash my hair
Then make 'em bounce like a basketball

But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear high heels
Yes, you, make me so nervous that I just can’t hold your hand

You make me glow
But I cover up, won’t let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don’t wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I’d have a heart attack
I think I’d have a heart attack
I think I’d have a heart attack

Never break a sweat for the other guys
When you come around, I get paralyzed
And every time I try to be myself
It comes out wrong like a cry for help
It’s just not fair
Pain’s more trouble than it all is worth
I gasp for air
It feels so good, but you know it hurts

But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear perfume for you
Make me so nervous that I just can’t hold your hand

You make me glow
But I cover up, won’t let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don’t wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I’d have a heart attack
I think I’d have a heart attack
I think I’d have a heart attack

The feelings are lost in my lungs
They’re burning, I’d rather be numb
And there’s no one else to blame
So instead, I’ll take off in a run
I’m flying too close to the sun and I’ll burst into flames

You make me glow
But I cover up, won’t let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don’t wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I’d have a heart attack
I think I’d have a heart attack (Heart attack)
I think I’d have a heart attack (-Tack)
Oh, I think I’d have a heart attack

How it all turned to lies?
Sometimes I think﻿ that it's better to never ask why

Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try
You gotta get up and try try try

Eh, eh, eh

Funny how the heart can be deceiving
More than just a couple times
Why do we fall in love so easy
Even when it's not right

Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try
You gotta get up and try try try

Ever worried that it might be ruined
And does it make you wanna cry?
When you're out there doing what you're doing
Are you just getting by?
Tell me are you just getting by by by

Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try
You gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try
You gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try

I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

So rock me mama like a wagon wheel

Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me

Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more

So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me

Walking to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I got to get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free

So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Oh rock me mama like the wind and the rain

I’m the Rap Critic. Let’s talk about Wale. Now, as you remember, I was quite fond of his single “Lotus Flower Bomb” from Last year. It had a great atmosphere and realistically portrayed the scenario of meeting someone you’re attracted to for the first time. Since then, Wale has had quite a bit of success. His album’s gone gold, and his touring around the world. However, I still feel like he’s not as big as he should be yet. He doesn’t seem like a breakout star as much as someone who’s still kinda in his label head’s shadow. You know, I could make a joke about how it might be literally hard to get out of Rick Ross’s shadow, but that would be making a fat joke, and I’m… I just did it anyways… I’m sorry… But seriously, I feel like “Lotus Flower Bomb” wasn’t as big as it should have been, seeing that it barely cracked the top 40, and that his other singles didn’t even come close. So, Wale’s back again this year with another love song single from his new album that seems to be doing a lot better than its spiritual predecessor, called “Bad”. Now, as soon as I see that word, I’m reminded of how every rap song seems to fit that word into the phrase ""bad bitch""
…but, I don’t think Wale’s gonna go that route, at least not in such a simplistic sense. Listening to “Lotus Flower Bomb” leads me to think that he takes the topic of women more seriously than that, at least when he’s rapping on his own. But, I’ve been wrong before… in almost every intro to every episode, so let’s see what he does!
*Music video intro, I look confused*
Um, are you putting a commercial for your album before the music video?... Did anyone ever tell you that music videos ARE commercials for albums?
Well, skipping a full minute past the ad, which makes that ad 1/5th of the music video, we finally get to the… nope, first we have to listen to two girls ordering food from a Spanish guy who doesn’t speak English
…'Kay (Que?)… but then, one of the girls gives her number to the Spanish guy they got their food from, not because they had a good conversation, which is impossible, because as previously stated, he doesn’t speak English, but simply because they heard the word “numero”, which they know means number
”I can’t believe you!”
Me neither! Why is this happening?
“Monogamy or whatever you call it
I'm starting to think it ain't for everybody”
Especially now that fame has made more women want to have sex with me *thumbs up, smile*
“Most of us is rushing into it anyways, you know what I'm saying
You ain't rushing for love, and I ain't up here to judge
So let's neglect the ""what if""'s and make it do what it does”
Man, this song raises some pretty good points in its intro, doesn’t it. I mean, we’re so eager to be intimate with those we find attractive, but it’s not to have a lasting relationship, it’s because of a primal sexual urge that we’re trying to satisfy. And he offers that we can’t stop it, so let’s just give in to it. Now, what I like about this song is that there’s a lot of nuance in it, in that it doesn’t necessarily paint that ideology positively
""Is it bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck""
Ms Tiara Thomas delivers this chorus hauntingly well, as, even though it drops the F bomb in the first few seconds of the chorus like that, I feel like it works perfectly for the meaning of the song. From the get go, it starts with a very vulnerable question, impressing upon the listener the dichotomy of sex in her mind, indicating by the second lines that she takes pride in her ability to physically satisfy her lover, but by the first line, showcasing an insecurity and indeed remorsefulness about the fact that she has never had the type of sex that links physicality with a deeper emotional trust. And we’re not done yet
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to you
I can't promise that I'll be good to you
You know, with each line from her somber yet sultry vocal delivery, you can interpret each lyric of the chorus as either a cocky expression of sexual liberation, departing from the idea of perceiving sex on an emotional level, or as a regretful admission of her possible inability to perceive sex as having an emotional context
""Cause I’ve had some issues, I won't commit""
Now, allow me to explain something that might ruin this chorus for you. Now, you may have noticed the bed spring sounds in the background, and as much as they kind of get on my nerves, there’s an explanation for it. You see, this chorus isn’t originally from this song. It’s from another song originally by Tiara Thomas called “Bad”, which itself is actually a semi-remake of a crunk song from 2004 by Trillville, called “Some Cut”, and it’s about, well…
""What it is ho, what's up
Can a nigga get in them guts""
Yeah, and here’s the thing: this interesting chorus awkwardly wraps around the chorus of the song by Trillville, And boy, if you ever wondered whether a crunk song about sex from a male perspective translates well into a smooth, delicately sung R and B song done by a women, well, you’ve got your answer
What it is ho, what's up
Can a nigga get in them guts
Cut you up like you ain't been cut
Show your ass how to really catch a nut
Is this supposed to be a joke? Because if you’re gonna do that, don’t write a serious hook around it. That’s just confusing. That’d be like if Alanis Morrisette did that jokingly serious version of “My Humps”, but replaced the verses with lines about soul-crushing heartbreak. It’s kind of unclear whether or not you understand how ridiculous it sounds
“And I'll follow that ass in the mall
Take you home, let you juggle my (whoa!)”
Balls. The word that originally goes there is “balls”. You know, in a remake of a song that starts off with “lemme get in them guts”, the time to censor yourself has passed
And thank God that for Wale’s version, they only used her original parts of this song
“Bad, that I never made love, no I never did” *squeaking*
They could have left off the bed squeaking though
Bad girls ain't no good, and the good girls ain't no fun
You know, this is a pretty dangerous mindset to put yourself in, and what’s annoying is that what he’s describing is actually a very popular opinion. Outright acknowledging that bad girls are not the ones you should go for, but going for them anyways because, “the good girls aren’t any fun!” That’s a terrible mentality to put yourself in! That’s like if girls only went for the bad boys because they’re allegedly “more fun” and “mysterious” and… oh, wait, that does happen… Huh. It’s pretty bad on both ends, isn’t it?
And the hood girls want a smart nigga, college girls all want a thug
So it seems that we fiend what we don't need
It’s kinda funny, a lot of people want to attract someone who’s a stark contrast to themselves, with their justification being “because I wanna have fun” and “they’re interesting and challenging”, but ironically, those “fun” and “interesting” people always end up ruing their lives and making them jaded against opening up to people who will actually care about them. Jeez, it’s almost like we’re stupid
Got a thing for a queen who know when to leave
I ain't bout to judge you, don't judge me
Hey, I’m not judging you for being a sexually liberated woman who doesn’t need a relationship to be happy, so don’t judge me for indicating that, after sex, I don’t see you as important to me anymore. What? What did I—what?
Cause I heard you (bad no), yeah
In the literal sense I mean that
Rough sex saying I love you
But to kiss them saying you mean that
Huh, so you can say “I love you” all you want, but only when you kiss them is when you mean it? If you don’t want to indicate that you love someone, shouldn’t you just, like, NOT say it?
But the problem is probably a deep past
Hm. Or, maybe, this need to say “I love you” stems from a deep-seeded desire that really wants love, but since the actuality of finding someone to love is truly hard to detect, and could lead to being hurt, we settle only for a superficial intimacy, one that’s ultimately unsatisfying but at least gives us something physical to cling to that verifies that someone in this cold world who knows very little about us can find us desirable, even if that desire is fleeting. I’m really liking how thought-provoking this song is so far. And the best part is, he’s doing it without any hard rhyming stuff that plagues a lot of his material. And yeah, a lot of people do that, but it’s particularly jarring when he does it, because with him…
*sample from “Miami Nights”*
Look, I know you not gay or nothing
But we should find another girl with a tapeworm
She graduated top of the class
Carol City or was it the west
Hold up I dont remember really, hold up
I'm in a rental on Collins
Me and my compadres, burning up Barneys
…he doesn’t even try to make the words sound similar! It’s almost like he’s challenging you call him out on it. And to all people who think rhyming the words aren’t necessary: Look, If you want to go on record to make a statement about something without having the need to rhyme words. That’s great! Write a speech! Put a beat behind it if you feel so inclined. But if you’re in a chosen medium, there are certain elemental things that are there for a reason. I don’t know about you guys, but whenever I hear two lines next to each other that don’t rhyme, I hear the writer saying, “I need to find a rhyme for the word I just put at the end of this line that will work in the context of the next line… *whine* but that sounds hard! But, like I said, he seems to be in check of that, because it doesn’t seem to be happening as blatantly in this song… wait, doesn’t it…
""Still I'm feeling it's something I need bad *C’mon*
Thinking if I get her, I get her to need this *No, plea--*
I don't need emotions to open your deep sea *It doesn’t have to be this way*
I can see the ocean by going between legs""
*sighs* Well, at least there were some internal rhymes. But, going back to his message, I think these lyrics serve the song’s purpose well. In this instance, these synonyms for open waters symbolize both the vast deepness and mystery of a person, and a hyperbole for her sexual stimulation, and by him saying that he doesn’t “need” emotions, he’s directly comparing these two metaphorical meanings, and ultimately choosing sexual gratification as a more satisfying body of water to explore
She hurt feelings, she break hearts
She stay quiet, she play smart
She take pride in going out
Getting hollered at, and saying nah
And here is where he starts to really break down her character, specifically noting how she’s prideful of her abilities to seduce men. But it’s not just the seduction she enjoys: it’s the rejection she deals out that inflates her ego. It’s the idea of, “*sultry* yeah, I could have you at any moment if I wanted, *dismissive* but eh, I don’t really feel like it. The thing is, though, this song doesn’t make her out to be like some super villain or anything like that. Yeah, she takes pride in her looks and sexual prowess, but there’s lots of context scattered throughout the song that lets you know that her decisions were made based on her reality. She’s had issues that make her unwilling to commit, which can very easily connotate to a situation where a man took advantage of her trust, leading her to being resilient of ever letting any other man have that emotional power, which can just as very easily lead her to getting a certain gratification in having sexual power over other men in her life
I ain't tryna kiss up, suck up, feed gas
I ain't like them *blank* you sucking your teeth at
Wait, play the chorus of this video. “I sure know how to fuck”. Now play that line again. “I ain't like them *blank* you sucking your teeth at”. Why do you randomly edit your songs, dude? Same thing happened last year with “Lotus Flower Bomb”! I can’t believe “not” cursing is a complaint I’m having about a rapper, but dude, have some consistency!
Play big, trust me I'll humble your mean ass, look
Now this is interesting development, as Wale seems confident that he will be the person to break through her exterior and be the one man that will change her mind about relationships. A bit of a parallel to “Lotus Flower Bomb”, actually. So, I wonder if he’ll get to her and they’ll fall in--
""Love?""
Well…
""Nah. Called in the morning cell number wasn't on, goddamn""
Oh. I guess not. I mean, you could argue that maybe her cell phone battery may have died or maybe she just had her phone off since last night so that no one would bother them, but after the way her character is described, you know what’s up. Also, I like how he uses a very staccato flow at the tail end of each verse describing their exploits, right before each one ends with her leaving him:
Beg, nope, bed, floor, dope, Go, for it, couch, now
Slow, mo-tion, around, put it down
Lord knows she was going for the morn, hold up
Bed, floor, couch, more, more, shower, Lord, perm, Done. Love, nah
Called in the morning cell number wasn't on, goddamn
In a way, it lights their sexual ventures as quick, fleeting vignettes ultimately ending with him sounding seemingly unappeased at her absence, despite his earlier line about “wanting a girl who knows when to leave”. Indeed the song ends up painting Wale as foolish for, at first, thinking nothing of sex as pure pleasure, but then, falling too hard for her and misguidedly starting to believe that an evening with her could lead to anything substantial. What’s more is that since he doesn’t really know her, his longing can only be related to how he felt the sex between them was a significant interaction because it was so good, which is indicative of how we can sometimes substitute the idea of someone who can sexually satisfy us for someone who can emotionally connect with us. Mon, this episode was not as funny as I thought it was gonna bee…
Overall, I’d give this a 4 out of 5. I like the way this song presents its premise and the way Wale executes his descriptions. It properly depicts a reality that could be taken with a grain of salt as yet another “bad girl” anthem, but can be looked at closer as an inspection of the “hook-up” lifestyle and what’s going on in terms of how the people involved may feel about their situations, concerning men and with women. The hard rhymes can be distracting at time, but altogether, the way this song fleshes out its context more than makes up for it

Face just showered, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news, whole day went sour
Lil mama got me feeling like a lemon-head
Put you in the box just as poisonous as cigarettes
Give 'em my regards or regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless
Gettin' mad cause the quarter million on my necklace
DUI never said I was driving reckless
You and I know that jealously is not impressive
Oh no I can't stop, I was destined

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

Champagne buckets still got two tears in it
And I put that on my tattoo of Jimi Hendrix
Get the pressed leather outfit all in it
Cuz the press tell it all get a meal ticket
Clean next get a call just a lil visit
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Reality stressed when you're blessed, just kill critics
Buggatti never meant I'm rich, just God-fearing
Look at me steering, got the bossing staring
Got a good feelin', Mr. Mike Caren
Tell his Billie Jeans, I'm on another planet
Thank E-Class, Big Chuck or Lee Prince Perries
Buy my momma chandeliers on my tears dammit
Thirty years you had thought these emotions vanish
Tryna live tryna figure how my sister vanish
No cheers I know you wouldn't panic

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down, I know it's all better now
When I need a healing, I just look up the the ceiling
I see the sun coming down I know its all better now
When I need a healing, I just look up the the ceiling

Hey! Hey!

I don't like walking around this old and empty house
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you my dear
The stairs creak as you sleep; it's keeping me awake
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
Some days I can't even dress myself
It's killing me to see you this way
'Cause though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
Well, tell her that I miss our little talks
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young, and full of life and full of love
Some days, I don't know if I am wrong or right
Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear
'Cause though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore

Hey!

You're gone, gone, gone away; I watched you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart; there's nothing we can do
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon
Now wait, wait, wait for me; please hang around
I'll see you when I fall asleep

Hey! Don't listen to a word I say

Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, ""Stick it!""
So sick, I'm looking pale—wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) all night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, go berserk, grab your vial, yeah

Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't that aftershave
Or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's bangin', jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yes siree 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang
Pow-p-p-p-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowin' up a valve, valve-valve
Ain't slowin' down, throw in the towel, towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is, are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho…

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) all night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, go berzerk, get your vinyls!


They say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian, Lamar, oh
Sorry, yo—we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though, that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone: car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl, you're fixin' to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain, baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman, unless you're a swallow
Word, Rick? (Word, man, you heard)
But don't get discouraged, girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) all night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So, baby, make just like K-Fed

Riding waves, playing acrobat
Shadowboxing the other half
Learning how to react

Addicted to the love I found
Heavy heart, now a weightless cloud
Making time for the ones that count
I'll spend the rest of my time
Laughing hard with the windows down
Leaving footprints all over town
Keeping faith, karma comes around
I will spend the rest of my life

Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show

Burnt lungs, sour taste

Struggling to pay rent

Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

The cars were cutting like knives in a fist fight
And I found you with a bottle of wine
Your head in the curtains
And heart like the fourth of July
You swore and said
We are not
We are not shining stars
This I know
I never said we are
Though I've never been through hell like that
I've closed enough windows
To know you can never look back

If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
Carry on
Carry on, carry on

So I met up with some friends
At the edge of the night
At a bar off 75
And we talked and talked
About how our parents will die
All our neighbors and wives
But I'd like to think
I can cheat it all
To make up for the times I've been cheated on
And it's nice to know
When I was left for dead
I was found and now I don't roam these streets
I am not the ghost you want of me

If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
Carry on
Carry on, carry on

Woah
My head is on fire
But my legs are fine
After all they are mine
Lay your clothes down on the floor
Close the door
Hold the phone
Show me how
No one's ever gonna stop us now


Cause we are
We are shining stars
We are invincible
We are who we are
On our darkest day
When we're miles away
So we'll come
We will find our way home

If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
Carry on
Carry on, carry on

No one's ever gonna stop us now"

Going to sound like a winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that’s my kind of night!

Might sit down on my diamond plate tailgate
Put in my country right hip-hop mixtape
Little Conway, a little T-Pain, might just make it rain
You can hang your t-shirt on a limb
Hit that bank and we can ease on in
Soak us up a little moonlight
You know I know what you like, yeah!

All them other boys want to wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin’ down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Going to sound like a winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that’s my kind of night!
Yeah, that’s my kind of night!

My kinda-- your kind-- is this kind of night
We dance in the dark and your lips land on mine
Oh oh oh oh oh, gonna get our love on
Oh oh oh oh oh, time to get our buzz on

All them other boys want to wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin’ down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Going to sound like a winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that’s my kind of night!

Yeah, that’s my kind of night!
That’s my kind of night!

Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes
Lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me

Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it

Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me
Then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down
I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted
As soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently, I'm over-influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me

Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

Aw man… where is she takin' me?
Where is she takin' me?

All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me
Makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough

They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
That nigga's straight, man, that nigga ain't trippin'
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'ma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
Fall right in ****'s lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
And I hope that bitch that set him up out there
We gon' pop that bitch too
Wait hold up, ayy, I see somebody
Aha! Got them niggas, K-Dot, you good?
L****, you good?
Yeah, blood, I'm good – Dave, you good?
Dave? Dave, say somethin' – Dave?

I screamed his name ‘til the neighbours called the cops
I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver
Don’t know what I did next, all I know I couldn’t stop

Word got around to the barflies and the baptists
My mama’s phone started ringing off the hook
I can hear her now saying she ain’t gonna have it
Don’t matter how you feel, it only matters how you look

Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart

Wish I could be just a little less dramatic
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holding the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there’s nobody else to blame

Can’t get revenge and keep a spotless reputation
Sometimes revenge's just a choice you gotta make
My mama came from a softer generation
Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face

Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart

Powder your nose, paint your toes
Line your lips and keep 'em closed
Cross your legs, dot your eyes
And never let 'em see you cry

Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart"

Migos ft. Drake ""Versace""In June, Drake randomly released 4 songs at one time: his and J. Cole’s “Jodeci Freestyle"", PARTYNEXTDOOR’s “Over Here”, “The Motion"" with Sampha, and this banger by Atlanta rap trio Migos.

Produced by Noah ""40"" Shebib, the track features the usual suspects: Drake, Rick Ross, and Lil Wayne. A behind-the-scenes photo from this song's video shoot led to the ultra-famous ‘Drake Lean’ meme, one of the biggest memes of 2013! With an enthralling beat and a memorable hook, “No New Friends” was one of the most anthemic tracks of the year.84. Danny Brown ft. A$AP Rocky ""Kush Coma""83. Rick Ross ft. Future ""No Games""

One hit wonder or talented hit maker? That’s the question posed by Rich Homie Quan with his street anthem “Type of Way"". The song propelled the relatively unknown Atlanta native into the spotlight and a top 50 spot on Billboards Hot 100 after it was caught up by the streets and shared around the Internet - even Michigan State’s college football team is using it as their team anthem!54.

Joey Bada$$ “Unorthodox”Joey & Primo take it back to the golden age on this boom bap-esque joint. The minimalist production fits Joey’s flow perfectly and enables his complex delivery and dope bars to shine. Functioning as the first single from “Summer Knights”, Joey drops some surprises; explaining his reasoning behind not signing a major record deal and that he does verses for free!49.

Isaiah Rashad “Shot U Down (Remix)” ft. Jay Rock & Schoolboy Q”
TDE newcomer Isaiah Rashad’s best offering of 2013 came with this infectious hook laden remix of his original “I Shot U Down”. Featuring fellow TDE spitters Jay Rock & Schoolboy Q, the hard drums and longer verses propel the track to new heights. If it’s anything to go by, we could be looking at a future addition to the Black Hippy quartet.44. Childish Gambino “Sweatpants”
43. Tech N9ne “Fragile” ft. Kendrick Lamar, Kendall Morgan & ¡MAYDAY! 42. Mac Miller “Red Dot Music” ft. Action Bronson41. Jay Z “Oceans” ft. Frank Ocean40. J Cole “Forbidden Fruit” ft. Kendrick LamarAnother collaboration between good friends J. Cole and Kendrick Lamar led to one of the top singles off of Cole's album ""Born Sinner"". While Kendrick does not deliver a verse on it, the hook he gives us still is soothing and paints the religious theme throughout the song. Cole delivers two solid verses, talking about religion, his inner struggle, and even saying why he dropped his album the same day as Kanye West. One more from Lil Cole!39. Pusha T “Hold On” ft. Rick Ross38. Schoolboy Q “Man Of The Year”37. Earl Sweatshirt “Sunday” ft. Frank Ocean36. Jay Z “FuckwithmeyouknowIgotit” ft. Rick Ross35. Tyler, the Creator “IFHY” ft. Pharrell WilliamsThis is truly Tyler at his finest. From his beat to his bars, this track showcases Tyler’s supreme artistic talent. Oh, and there’s THAT VIDEO! The talk-rap, slow flow is personal and poetic. He combines crooning with curses effortlessly and elevates the track in doing so. The beat builds like a film. He even directed his idol Pharrell’s angelic voice on the bridge, with a melody Tyler created himself. Sonically this track was standout, and then he made that video and this became undeniably next-level. 34. Jay Z “Tom Ford”33. J Cole “Crooked Smile” ft. TLC32. Kendrick Lamar “Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe Remix” ft. Jay Z
31. Chance The Rapper “Acid Rain” 30. Childish Gambino “Telegraph Ave (Oakland)”Perhaps the universal favorite from the album, this is a dark, entrancing look at the compulsive and haunting power of our past loves/infatuations. Like The Boy driving down Telegraph Ave, we can spend our time retreading the same roads thinking about “what ifs” and reminiscing about things lost – sometimes alongside the people with whom we lost them. But unless we decide to do something about all those lost things – whether to try again, or to walk away for good – all that wandering isn’t going to do us any good. Using Lloyd’s “Oakland” literally in the song, Gambino cleverly plays both rapper and listener creating and experiencing the track with us.29. Tyler, the Creator “Rusty” ft. Domo Genesis & Earl Sweatshirt28. Chance The Rapper “Favorite Song” ft. Childish Gambino27. A$AP Ferg “Work (Remix)” ft. A$AP Rocky, French Montana, SchoolBoy Q & Trinidad James
26. Pusha T “King Push” 25. Chance The Rapper “Juice”The first single off Acid Rap, Juice was one of the big breakthroughs this year for Chance. The first thing that catches your ears is Chance’s sing-songy, cartoony flow which you can’t help singing along to (some jumping around is mandatory). But listen closely, and you get Chancelor’s dope bars: dense, great-sounding internal rhymes and clever Chicago references. As you’re headbanging through the verse though, you’re hit with that absolutely HYPE chorus that is guaranteed to make you lose your shit. What you’re left with is one of the catchiest, most memorable songs of 2013 and a high point in the spectacular year Chance has had.24. Drake “Hold On We're Going Home” ft. Majid Jordan23. A$AP Ferg “Shabba” ft. A$AP Rocky22. J Cole “Let Nas Down”21. Eminem “Berzerk""20. Drake “Worst Behavior”This Nothing Was The Same stand-out combines Drizzy’s loud, arrogant hook with even more flexin’ in his verses. DJ Dahi delivers with gritty, bass-heavy production deceptively containing no sample. Like many tracks on NWTS, Drake’s flow and the beat changes up across the song -- he even confidently borrows flow and bars from Ma$e’s “Mo Money Mo Problems” anthem. The music video stars his actual dad and uncles and contains his worst skit to date. Even with lyrics that playfully reference his famous Hot 97 freestyle blunder and remind us of his Degrassi roots, Drake manages to make one of the hardest bangers of 2013. Just accept that you’ll never get the timing right for that initial “.......WORST!”19. Earl Sweatshirt “Hive” ft. Vince Staples & Casey VeggiesThe leaps and bounds of growth that Earl Sweatshirt has experienced over the last several years can really be heard on Doris' standout track, “Hive.” Fueled by a bassline that gives the song that dark, Odd Future feel, Earl spits much more mature bars using his now polished signature flow. With the addition of a great hook from young Casey Veggies, the song was already fantastic. But then Vince Staples busts in with a ski mask and absolutely kills it. Did Vince renegade Earl? That's up for debate, but you can't deny that Shyne, and everyone else on the song, absolutely did their thing.18. Eminem “Love Game” ft. Kendrick LamarWhen the MMLP2 tracklist was revealed, Love Game was one of the most heavily-anticipated tracks; everyone was envisioning a Renegade-level back-and-forth between Em and Kendrick. But the song turned out to be as left-field as possible. Backed by a quirky Rick Rubin-produced instrumental that could’ve come straight from the ‘50s (cheesy sample included), Eminem describes his time with an unfaithful woman in hilarious detail, while Kendrick emulates Em’s flow and raps about his experiences with the infamous Sherane. Although a largely comical song, Love Game still has a lot of great rhymes, with an especially phenomenal third verse by Em. Despite their bad experiences with women, Marshall and K.Dot let us know that they’re always going to be playing the game of love!
17. Drake “Started From The Bottom”
“Started From The Bottom”, produced by Mike Zombie, was the first single off Drake's Nothing Was The Same album. The track was released in February and peaked at #6 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It has since been certified 2x Platinum. Some may doubt if Drake really did ‘start at the bottom’, but with 2.2 million pageviews on Rap Genius and one of the catchiest hooks of the year, there is no doubt that this track was one of the biggest anthems of 2013.16. Childish Gambino “3005”The lead single for Because the Internet is quintessential Childish Gambino, but is also a great showcase for the artist’s development over the last two years. It’s a good sampling of the album’s overall sound and texture. Gambino paints a great picture of how, if you don’t have someone you really care about beside you, you can be completely alone in a crowded room, to say nothing of dealing with the rest of the shit life throws at you. He both raps and sings exceptionally well and effortlessly here. Gambino also gave us a pleasantly metaphorical video to accompany the song and make us think even more.
15. Chance The Rapper “Cocoa Butter Kisses” ft. Vic Mensa & TwistaTwo generations of Chicago hip-hop converge on this mixtape cut, with one artist already garnering national attention introducing another to the scene and re-introducing an OG from his city. Vic steals the show with an urgent and unforgiving verse, and Chance happily cedes the spotlight to him, restraining himself to an unassumingly spry and sing-songy verse; Twista, on the other hand, is not quite so willing to take a back seat, successfuly lacing the track with his trademark double-time bars. But amidst the aggressively fast raps of the trio, the hook has a contrastingly soothing melody that rounds out the entire production. This track firmly announces that hip-hop is once again Chicagoan.
14. Jay Z “Holy Grail” ft. Justin TimberlakeIn a year of nervy choices that made business headlines around the world, Jay Z's boldest decision was actually a musical one. The only voice you hear during the first 1:19 of his new album's leadoff track is not Hov, but rather Justin Timberlake. This only manages to build anticipation, so that we are well-primed for the rapper's entry.And what an entry it is. His daughter's name is literally the first word out of his mouth, and with good reason. A post-fatherhood Jay is contemplative about the ups and downs of a personified fame, while admitting ultimately that he can't leave it alone. And lest we think he's lost a step, his patented wordplay is in full effect, with a pun on ""pigeons"" that puts today's coke-rappers to shame.13. ASAP Rocky “1 Train” ft. Kendrick Lamar, Joey Badass, Yelawolf, Danny Brown, Action Bronson and Big K.R.I.T.
""1 Train"" is the cypher to end all cyphers. A$AP Rocky amalgamated a line-up without a single weak spitter, and they all did their worst to this Hit-Boy produced banger. It's impossible to pick who delivered the best verse here: was it the energized Danny Brown? the lovable braggart Action Bronson? the wordsmith Joey Bad? the hard-driving Big K.R.I.T.? Someone else? I can't decide, but I do know this: the track is flames
12. Schoolboy Q “Collard Greens” Kendrick LamarA cut between two of Top Dawg Entertainment's main artists, Schoolboy Q and Kendrick Lamar came in to make a party banger just in time for summer. Schoolboy Q delivers a solid verse about his favorite things, (and how other people can't have them), before Kendrick comes in with that Español that makes this verse so memorable. The hook might be a little random, but the vibe it generates makes it infectious upon first listen.11. Kanye West “ Black Skinhead”When word dropped that Daft Punk would be working with Kanye West on his new album, it was fair to assume it would result in a genre-blending song like Stronger. What we ended up with was indeed a blend of genres, but instead of electronic synths and filtered vocals, we got primal screams and distorted 808’s. Kanye is pissed off, but not the kind of pissed he gets about croissants or Jimmy Kimmel. No, Ye is fed up with people questioning his choices and he’s frustrated that nobody is taking risks anymore. And it’s palpable in this song, which represents the rebellious, IDGAF attitude that flows from both Kanye and Yeezus. Using few else but drums and vocal sounds you’d more likely hear exploring the Amazon than in Hip Hop, Kanye crafts an uneasy, raw instrumental that pairs perfectly with his blunt lyrics10. J Cole “Power Trip” ft. MiguelIn classic J. Cole fashion, nearly everything on this track is done by himself. The smooth voice of Miguel helps out on a hook, but otherwise it is Cole’s world. The incredibly catchy hooks match up perfectly with his production and he drops plenty of relatable bars about a crush. This continuation of his 2009 song “Dreams” is about not only a girl, but also hip-hop and its impact on him - giving an already impressive song some duality. And much like the song sounds, its video felt like a short film as Cole literally does whatever it takes to claim his love. The 10th most viewed song on RG in 2013, fans spent a combined 7.5 years of time on this song page!09. Drake “Pound Cake/Paris Morton Music 2” ft. Jay ZDrake crafts one of the most memorable tracks of 2013 with the outro to his third studio LP Nothing Was The Same. Boi-1da delivers on Pound Cake with a spacey Ellie Goulding sample as Drizzy paints the picture about what his life has been like while recording and making the album.The song isn’t finished there by any means. After two Jay verses, Drake comes back in for Paris Morton Music 2 and a perfect verse to remind us this is his song. The extra long PMM 2 verse is also very personal, looking back on the landscape of  his career and perhaps how he’s no longer the same
08. Pusha T “Numbers On The Boards”
My Name Is My Name is a stark minimalist creation and with the “No Artwork” cover, “Numbers On The Boards” is the centerpiece. Don Cannon & Kanye West create the spine with King Push on his super Lupe raps in between catchy samples. Push said all year he wanted to bring “that feeling back”, and “Numbers On The Boards” knocks harder than him thumping the wall with his fist. The lyrically enthralling track is jam packed with references and double entendres that takes you to Pusha’s dark underground hell in only a way he could.07. “Kanye West - Bound 2” ft. Charlie Wilson
“Bound 2” was an unexpected but wholly welcome ending to Yeezus. The song has sparked wide discussion: is it a rejection of the past 37 minutes? Is it a reassurance to fans about Kanye’s present musical identity? Is it a revelation about Kanye’s future? Who really cares? Kanye fans who hated Yeezus loved it and Kanye fans who loved Yeezus loved it. “Bound 2” is a weirdly endearing love song featuring classic Kanye flow floating over soul samples, topped with Charlie Wilson’s magical voice. What’s not to like?! Well, many would actually say “the video”, which was an overtly cheesy, green-screened, steamy motorcycle ride that not only made the world cringe, but also felt like the furthest thing from Ye’s aesthetic. But that was the point. Ye geniusly defied our expectations and used his prettiest song’s video as a commentary on the “wack” quality of American art and media that he feels should be banned. How very, New Slaves of him.06. Eminem “Bad Guy”Sequels to much-loved properties are rarely a good idea. For every The Empire Strikes Back, there are three Matrix Reloadeds.  So when word leaked out that Em had recorded a follow-up to his epic 2000 story-song “Stan,” fans were nervous.  After all, Stan died at the end, right? So what’s left?Plenty, as it turns out.  Marshall turned a potentially bad idea into fantastic art with his imagining of Stan’s little brother Matthew (with the autographed Starter cap), now all grown up and seeking revenge.  But just as the tale reaches its apex, the song switches perspective, revealing an intense look at Eminem’s self-doubts and anguish. Just before the end, he drops the biggest gem of all: his in-song tormentors are “just symbolic/Of not knowing what you had ‘til it’s gone.”  The rapper himself may not know, but trust us, Slim, we do.05. Pusha T “Nosetalgia” ft. Kendrick LamarThis genre defining song starts with a dirty Nottz beat that makes you feel like committing a crime and quickly escalates to the feeling you’re part of one. The KRS sample serves as the hook and sounds of scratches fill the airwaves. Kings Push & Kendrick come through with menacing delivery and complex wordplay. While Terrence is neck deep in dealing, Kendrick is in the midst of consumption - the contrast is phenomenal, both MC’s affected by the crack epidemic in opposing instances. The insight into Kendrick’s story is rare, the Compton native always let us ride around his house but never let us through the front door. “Nosetalgia” is your 8ball on a Friday night, 4 shots of espresso every morning, and the In N Out double double you crave in LA. It’s dope. 04. Kanye West “Blood On The Leaves”
Blood On The Leaves introduces a new piece into the emotional puzzle of Yeezus: remorse. The song is drowning in so many feels, it’s impossible not to catch some yourself. Kanye’s autotuned story of sadness begins atop the somber piano of the beautifully chopped Strange Fruit sample, but then the blaring horns and bass of TNGHT’s R U Ready burst through and all of a sudden that sadness turns to rage. By the end of it all you’re left with a modern day power ballad with enough autotune and raw emotion to make Future blush. Blood On The Leaves got to a bit of a slow start on Rap Genius due to lack of exposure pre-album release, but thanks in part to Kanye’s emotionally charged VMA performance the song is one of the most viewed Yeezus tracks on the site. The song’s instrumental has also become one of Producer Genius’ prized breakdowns, explaining the use of the song’s controversial Nina Simone sample and the origin of that beat drop. Can you imagine if Yeezus started off with this song, like Kanye originally planned? The world would have imploded.03. Eminem “Rap God”
”Six minutes, Slim Shady, you’re on”. After the novelty of a second Marshall Mathers LP began to wear off, Eminem got the buzz back by becoming the third MC this year to proclaim himself a god. This rapid-fire lyrical tour de force is laced with references to the first Mathers LP, sneak disses to some of his old buddies, and a 17 second stretch crammed with over 100 words. The Detroit native also broke Rap Genius the day ""Rap God"" was released, and has now amassed over 4 million page views
Proving himself in the booth was just the beginning for Slim. After criticism he lip synced on live television, Marshall Mathers showed up to the YouTube music awards and destroyed the hopes and dreams of every rapper alive when he performed the song live. It’s safe to say ""Rap God"" proved the internal rhyme mastermind is back on his Pharoahe Monch grind and nothing’s going to stop him.02. Big Sean “Control” ft. Kendrick Lamar & Jay ElectronicaYou all knew this was coming. Big Sean delivered a 3 minute dope verse to open the track. Comparing his rapping skill to a baby's first steps and reminiscing on his grandfather, he manages to give one of the best verses of his career. For obvious reasons, we'll skip to Jay Electronica next. He too spit a clean verse about religion, while sneaking in TV and car references, and even mentioning his late grandmother, much like Sean did.
However, there was a 3rd feature to this monster track produced by No I.D. His name? King Kendrick Lamar. He came with one purpose: to assassinate the competition. The lyrical warfare was on for all to see and was full of levels. The Compton MC proclaimed he was both 2Pac's offspring and the King of New York, causing mass hysteria in hip hop’s homeland. But oh no, it wasn’t over yet. His braggadocio left mouths agape as he goes on to say he is as popular as the Beatles and placed his name up for one of the greatest MC's of all time. And yet there was more...he called out every hot young rapper - by their name, a rarity in Hip Hop (no sneak disses here!). Basically Kendrick manages to piss off every rapper and revolutionize the rap game at the same damn time. How about it?
01. Kanye West “New Slaves” ft. Frank Ocean
""New Slaves"" is best described as an “open letter” from Kanye West to the people - made into music. Produced by the Very G.O.O.D Beats crew, New Slaves is sonically simplistic yet still possesses melody courtesy of the droning synths. Frank Ocean assists on the outro, providing an amazing contrast to the aggressive tone used throughout the song, acting in a reflective manner. However from a lyrical standpoint it’s without a doubt one of Kanye’s greatest songs. He labeled verse 2 as the “best verse of all time” and with topics that range from modern day slavery to the fashion industry, and even America's prison system, it’s hard to disagree
The Chi-town native doesn’t just stop at the music. With a guerrilla marketing scheme fit for a military coup, Ye projected the track onto buildings in 66 locations across the world. It’s been 8 months since the song’s release and the significance of ”New Slaves is only just surfacing. Between the time of the song’s release and present day, the attitude of multiple industries has started to shift dramatically - would Jay Z and Beyonce have released projects with such unorthodox promotion methods if Kanye didn’t do it first? His movement, spearheaded with this peoples anthem, was made to inspire others to think in a similar light. ”New Slaves” invokes the power of free speech and brandishing the truth like an axe, Kanye challenges listeners to think outside the Matrix
Just as Mandela blew up the buildings and eventually became president. Contrary to popular opinion, sometimes you have to blow up the building.— Kanye West"

You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug
You can be the outcast
Or be the backlash of somebody’s lack of love
Or you can start speaking up
Nothing’s gonna hurt you the way that words do
When they settle ‘neath your skin
Kept on the inside and no sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins
But I wonder what would happen if you

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out

Everybody’s been stared down by the enemy
Fallen for the fear
And done some disappearing
Bow down to the mighty
Don’t run, stop holding your tongue
Maybe there’s a way out of the cage where you live
Maybe one of these days, you can let the light in
And show me, how big your brave is

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave

And since your history of silence
Won't do you any good
Did you think it would?
Let your words be anything but empty
Why don't you tell them the truth?

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out

I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright

My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around
Through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing
In my head for you

My head's under water, but I'm breathin' fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me

You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

Give me all of you, oh
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you

I give you all of me

I see this life, like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
And in my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye' shall find
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told

I-I-I-I feel something so right
Doing the wrong thing
I-I-I-I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
