I can't get no satisfaction
Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm driving in my car
And that man comes on the radio
And he's telling me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination
I can't get no, oh no, no, no!
Hey, hey, hey! That's what I'll say!

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm watching my TV
And a man comes on and tells me
How white my shirts can be
Well he can't be a man cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me
I can't get no, oh no, no, no
Hey, hey, hey, that's what I say

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no girl reaction
'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm riding round the world
And I'm doing this and I'm signing that
And I'm trying to make some girl
Who tells me baby, better come back, maybe next week
'Cause you see, I'm on a losing streak
I can't get no, oh no, no, no

There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb

Everybody that was hangin' out

Aw, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But ya know ya only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street
And now you’re gonna have to get used to it

With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, “Do you want to make a deal?""

To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown

Aw, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal?

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To hang on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Aw, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchangin' all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring, ya better pawn it, babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls ya, ya can't refuse
When ya ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now, ya got no secrets to conceal

How does it feel?
Aw, how does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home

Just once in my life let me hold on to
The good thing I found don't let me down
Baby say that you'd be staying
Cause I couldn't face the day if you weren't here by my side
And if you went away then I'd be left without any pride

I've given up so many things don't ask me to give up on you
And baby, baby just once in my life
I'm gonna get what I want girl don't let me down
Just once in my life
Let me hold on to the good thing I found don't let me down
Baby say that you'd be staying
That old pot of gold ain't so easy to find
But if you'll stand by me
Girl I'll keep peace of mind
I can't give you the world
But I'll work hard for you girl
I'll work hard, everyday, all my life
If you'll say you won't leave me
Baby don't leave me
Please don't leave me
Baby don't leave me

Once in my life, let me get what I want
Girl don't let me down;

Oh yeah, Mmmm
Just once in my life let me get what I want
Girl don't let me down;
Just once in my life let me hold onto
A good thing I've found, don't let me down. (fade)"

A high AERIAL SHOT of the island features the Statue of Liberty
prominently in the foreground then TRAVELS ACROSS the harbor, OVER the
Battery and Lower Manhattan to Greenwich Village.
EXT. EAST 77TH STREET - DAY
A car is being hoisted up by a municipal tow truck while its owner is
having a terrible screaming arguement with a parking enforcement officer.
DANA BARRETT comes home pushing a baby buggy, struggling with two full
bags of groceries, and trying to dig her keys out of her purse. The
building superintendent FRANK, sees her struggling but pretends not to
notice.
DANA
(exasperated)
Frank, do you think you could give me a hand
with these bags?
FRANK
I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett. I'm a
building superintendent.
DANA
You're also a human being, Frank.
FRANK
(reluctantly going to help)
Okay, okay. It's not my job, but what the
hell. I'll do you a favor. He takes the
grocery bags from her.
DANA
(setting the wheel brakes on
the buggy)
Thank you, Frank. I'll get the hang of this
eventually.
She continues digging in her purse while Frank leans over the buggy and
makes funny faces at the baby, OSCAR, a very cute nine-month old boy.
FRANK
(to the baby)
Hiya, Oscar. What do you say, slugger?
FRANK
(to Dana)
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms.
Barrett.
DANA
(finding her keys)
Thank you, Frank. Oh, are you ever going to
fix the radiator in my bedroom? I asked you
last week.
FRANK
Didn't I do it?
BABY BUGGY
It starts to vibrate as if shaken by an unseen hand.
EXT. EAST 77TH STREET - BABY - DAY
He GURGLES with delight at the movement.
EXT. EAST 77TH STREET - DANA AND FRANK - DAY
Neither of them notice the movement of the carriage.
DANA
No, you didn't, Frank.
FRANK
Okay, that's no problem.
DANA
That's exactly what you said last week.
BUGGY WHEELS
The brakes unlock themselves.
DANA
She reaches for the handlebar of the buggy, but the buggy rolls forward
just out of her reach and stops. Surprised by the movement, she reaches
for the handlebar again, but this time the buggy rolls away even
further. Alarmed now, Dana hurries after it, but the buggy keeps
rolling down the street at ever increasing speed.
SIDEWALK
Dana chases the buggy down the street, shouting to passing pedestrians
for help, but every time someone reaches out to stop it, the buggy
swerves and continues unchecked.
INTERSECTION
Cars, trucks, and buses speed by in both directions as the buggy races
toward the corner.
DANA
She puts her head down and sprints after the buggy like an Olympian.
EXT. EAST 77TH STREET - INTERSECTION - DAY
A city bus is on a collision course with the speeding baby buggy.
BUGGY
It careens toward the corner.
EXT. EAST 77TH STREET - BABY - DAY
Its eyes are wide open with excitement.
EXT. EAST 77TH STREET - INTERSECTION - DAY
Bus and buggy are closing fast as the buggy bounces over the curb and
into the crosswalk.
BUS
The bus driver reacts in helpless horror as he sees the buggy enter the
intersection at high speed.
BUGGY
It comes to a dead stop right in the middle of the street. The bus
continues missing the buggy by inches.
INTERSECTION
Cars and trucks swerve and hit their brakes as Dana runs into the
intersection and snatches up the baby. She hugs it close, deeply
relieved, then looks at the buggy with the dawning awareness that the
supernatural has re-entered her life.
CUT TO:
EXT. UPPER WEST SIDE - NEW YORK CITY STREET - GHOSTBUSTERS LOGO - DAY
THEME MUSIC kicks in strongly as we see the familiar ""No Ghosts"" symbol
and PULL BACK to reveal that it's painted on the side of Ecto-1, the
Ghostbusters' emergency vehicle, which is speeding up Broadway on the
Upper West Side. RAY STANTZ is driving and WINSTON ZEDDEMORE is riding
shotgun.
EXT. WEST 77TH STREET - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)
The Ectomobile pulls up in front of a carefully-restored brownstone.
Stantz and Winston, wearing their official Ghostbuster uniforms, jump
out of the old ambulance, shoulder their proton packs and enter the
house.
INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
A WOMAN greets them and leads them through the expensively-furnished
house.
STANTZ
(all business)
How many of them are there, ma'am?
WOMAN
Fourteen. They're in the back. I hope you can
handle them. It's been like a nightmare.
WINSTON
How big are they?
She holds her hand out indicating about four feet.
WINSTON
(resolute)
We'll do our best, ma'am.
WOMAN
They're right out here.
She leads them to a set of French doors that open into another room.
Stantz and Winston pause to make final adjustments to their equipment.
STANTZ
Ready?
WINSTON
I'm ready.
STANTZ
Then let's do it.
He pushes through the French doors and they step into the room.
INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
They are immediately attacked by fourteen or fifteen screaming KIDS
between the ages of seven and ten.
KIDS
(disappointed)
Ghostbusters!! Boooo!!
Tables are set with party favors, ice cream and birthday cake and the
room is strewn with discarded toys and games. A couple of weary parents
sink onto lawn chairs as Stantz and Winston take over the party.
WINSTON
(trying his best)
How you doin', kids?
LITTLE BOY
(nasty)
I though we were having He-Man.
STANTZ
He-Man couldn't make it today. That's why
we're here.
BOY
My dad says you're full of crap.
STANTZ
(stopped cold)
Well, a lot of people have trouble believing
in the paranormal.
BOY
No, he just says you're full of crap and that's
why you went out of business.
He kicks Stantz in the leg. Stantz grabs him by the shirtfront.
STANTZ
(low and menacing)
I'm watching you.
(to Winston)
Song.
Winston switches on a tiny TAPE RECORDER which starts PLAYING the
Ghostbusters THEME SONG. Stantz and WInston start singing
STANTZ AND WINSTON
'There's something wrong in the neighborhood.
Who you gonna call?'
KIDS
(all together)
He-Man!!
CUT TO:
EXT. WEST 77TH STREET - DAY (LATER)
Stantz and Winston wearily load their equipment into the Ectomobile.
WINSTON
That's it, Ray. I've had it. No more parties.
I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged
nine-year-olds.
STANTZ
Come on, Winston. We can't quit now. The
holidays are coming up. It's our best season.
They get in the car
INT. ECTO-1 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
Stantz tries to start the car, but the engine won't turn over.
WINSTON
Give it up, Ray. You're living in the past.
Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore. In a year
these kids won't even remember who we are.
STANTZ
(tries to start the car again)
Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae. After all we
did for this city.
WINSTON
Yeah, what did we do, Ray? The last real job
we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow
man and blew the top three floors off an uptown
highrise.
STANTZ
Yeah, but what a ride. You can't make a
hamburger without chopping up a cow.
He turns the key again, the ENGING TURNS OVER, then starts GRINDING and
CLUNKING disastrously, chewing up vital parts and dropping twisted bits
of metal onto the pavement. Finally, with a BLAST of black sooty
exhaust from the tailpipe, Ecto-1 shudders and dies. Frustrated, Stantz
bangs his head lightly on the steering wheel
CUT TO:
INT. WKRR-TV STUDIO RECEPTION AREA - DAY (LATER)
A bank of monitors in the lobby show the program now running on WKRR,
Channel 10 in New York. We PUSH IN ON one of the monitors as a title
card and logo come up accompanied by some EERIE SYNTHESIZER MUSIC, and
we return to the show in progress: ""World of the Psychic with Dr. Peter
Venkman."" There is a video dissolve to a standard talk show set and
sitting there is our host PETER VENKMAN, the renowned and somewhat
infamous ex-Ghostbuster.
VENKMAN
He turns TO CAMERA and talks to his viewers in a suavely engaging tone,
understated and intimate.
VENKMAN
Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,'
I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest,
author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton
Anglund.
(to his guest)
Milt, your new book is called The End of the
World. Isn't that kind of like writing about
gum disease. Yes, it could happen, but do you
think anybody wants to read a book about it?
MILTON
Well, I think it's important for people to know
that the world is in danger.
VENKMAN
Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to
happen or do we have to buy the book?
MILTON
I predict that the world will end at the
stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
VENKMAN
This year? That's cutting it a little close,
isn't it? I mean, just from a sales point of
view, the book just came out, right? So you're
not even looking at the paperback release for
maybe a year. And it's going to be at least
another year after that if the thing has
movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential.
You would have been better off predicting 1992
or even '94 just to be safe.
MILTON
(irritated)
This is not just some money-making scheme! I
didn't just make up the date. I have a strong
psychic belief that the world will end on New
Year's Eve.
VENKMAN
(placating)
Well, for your sake, I hope you're right. But
I think my other guest may disagree with you.
Elaine, you had another date in mind?
The CAMERA REVEALS ELAINE, an attractive, aggressive New Jersey
housewife, sitting on the other side of Venkman.
ELAINE
According to my sources, the world will end
on February 14, in the year 2016.
VENKMAN
Valentine's Day. That's got to be a bummer.
Where did you get that date, Elaine?
ELAINE
I received this information from an alien. I
was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having
a drink in the bar when he approached me and
started talking. Then he must have used some
sort of ray or a mind control device because
he made me follow him to his room and that's
where he told me about the end of the world.
VENKMAN
Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
ELAINE
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made
up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn. I
can't be sure, Peter.
VENKMAN
(humoring her)
No, you can't, and I think that's the whole
problem with aliens; you just can't trust them.
You may get some nice ones occasionally like
Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to
be some kind of lizard. Anyway, we're just
about out of time.
(does his wrap-up right TO
the CAMERA)
Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless
pets.
(holds up a hairless cat)
Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...
(puts a finger to his temple
and sends out a though to his
viewers)
... Good night.
CUT TO:
INT. TV STUDIO - CORRIDOR - DAY (LATER)
Venkman comes out of the studio squabbling with his producer, NORMAN, a
well-meaning young incompetent.
VENKMAN
Where do you find these people? I thought
we were having the telekinetic guy who bends
the spoons?
NORMAN
A lot of the better psychics won't come on the
show. They think you're too skeptical.
VENKMAN
Skeptical! Norman, I'm a pushover. I think
professional wrestling is real.
There is a small commotion down the hall as two plainclothes cops come
out of the next studio followed by a group of mayoral assistants.
VENKMAN
(to Norman)
What's all this?
NORMAN
They just interviewed the mayor on 'Cityline.'
VENKMAN
The Mayor! He's a friend of mine.
Venkman starts down the hall as the MAYOR and his principal aide, JACK
HARDEMEYER, come walking out of the studio.
VENKMAN
(calling to the Mayor)
Lenny!
The Mayor sees Venkman, blanches and hurries off, pretending not to know
him.
VENKMAN
(starts to follow him)
Lenny! It's Pete Venkman!
The plainclothesmen cut Venkman off and Hardemeyer puts a heavy hand
against Venkman's chest.
HARDEMEYER
(snide)
Can I help you?
VENKMAN
(dangerous)
Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.
Hardemeyer smiles and drops his hand.
HARDEMEYER
I'm Jack Hardemeyer. I'm the mayor's assistant.
What can I do for you?
VENKMAN
I'm an old friend of the mayor's. I just
want to say hello to him.
HARDEMEYER
(scornful)
I know who you are, Doctor Venkman. Busting
any ghosts lately?
VENKMAN
No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor
about. We did a little job for the city a
while back and we ended up getting sued,
screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.
HARDEMEYER
(bristling)
Look, you stay away from the mayor. Next fall,
barring a disaster, he's going to be elected
governor of this state and the last thing we
need is for him to be associated with two-bit
frauds and publicity hounds like you and your
friends. You read me?
Hardemeyer walks off with the two cops.
VENKMAN
Okay, I get it. But I want you to tell Lenny
that, because of you, I'm not voting for him.
CUT TO:
EXT. MANHATTAN MUSEUM OF ART - DAY
The broad front steps of the museum are crowded with tourists and
visitors. Dana arrives carrying a portfolio and artist's tackle box and
enters the museum.
INT. MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (LATER)
We are FULL-FRAME ON a larger-than-life, full-figure portrait of VIGO
THE CARPATHIAN, a demented and sadistic 16th century despot with an
incredibly powerful evil presence. Then we PULL BACK to reveal the
studio, which is a large open space on the top floor of the museum, lit
by large skylights in the ceiling. Working on the Vigo painting is
JANOSZ POHA, a youngish art historian and painter, the head of the
department, quirky, intense and somewhat creepy. Janosz is staring
longingly across the room at Dana.
DANA
She is carefully cleaning a 19th Century landscape painting, still
preoccupied by the extraordinary near-accident with the buggy. Janosz
watches her for a moment, then comes up behind her and looks over her
shoulder.
JANOSZ
(with an East European accent)
Still working on the Turner?
Dana jumps, startled by the intrusion.
DANA
Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning,
Janosz.
JANOSZ
You know, you are really doing very good work
here. I think soon you may be ready to assist
me in some of the more important restorations.
DANA
Thank you, Janosz. I've learned a lot here,
but now that my baby's a little older, I was
hoping to rejoin the orchestra.
VIGO PAINTING
At the mention of Dana's baby, the figure of Vigo miraculously turns his
head and looks at Dana.
JANOSZ AND DANA
Neither of them notice the movement in the painting.
JANOSZ
(disappointed)
We'll be very sorry to lose you. Perhaps I
could take you to lunch today?
DANA
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today. I have
an appointment.
(looks at her watch)
In fact, I'd better go.
She starts gathering up her things.
JANOSZ
Every day I ask you, and every day you've got
something else to do. Do I have bad breath
or something?
DANA
(trying to brush him off)
I'm sorry. Perhaps some other time.
JANOSZ
Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that.
Janosz smiles at her as she exits, then goes back to his easel.
JANOSZ
(to himself)
I think she likes me.
He switches on an English language TAPE and starts practicing the
phrases as he resumes working.
CUT TO:
EXT. UNIVERSITY - DAY
Dana Barrett crosses the quad and enters a modern building. A sign
identifies it as ""The Institute for Advanced Theoretical Research.""
INT. UNIVERSITY - DAY (A LITTLE LATER)
Dana is explaining the buggy incident to EGON SPENGLER, the soberly
intellectual techno-wizard and former Ghostbuster, as he conducts an
experiment assisted by a research team of graduate students, all of whom
are Japanese, Chinese, or Korean. The device he is testing is a black
box about the size of a Sony Watchman with both digital and graphic
displays.
DANA
... and then the buggy just suddenly stopped
dead in the middle of the street
SPENGLER
Did anyone else see this happen?
DANA
Hundreds of people. Believe me, I didn't
imagine this.
SPENGLER
I'm not saying you did. In science we always
look for the simplest explanation.
An ASSISTANT interrupts.
ASSISTANT
We're ready, Dr. Spengler
SPENGLER
(to the Assistant)
We'll start with the negative calibration.
He picks up the device and prepares to test it.
DANA
(curious)
What are you working on, Egon?
SPENGLER
I'm trying to determine whether human
emotional states have a measurable effect on
the psychomagnetheric energy field. It's a
theory Ray and I were working on when we had
to dissolve Ghostbusters.
An assistant draws a curtain revealing a large picture window, actually
a two-way mirror, that looks into a small waiting room. Inside the
waiting room they can see but not hear a youngish couple having a heated
arguement.
SPENGLER
(to Dana)
They think they're here for marriage
counseling. We've kept them waiting for two
hours and we've been gradually increasing the
temperature in the room.
(checking a heat sensor)
It's up to 95 degrees at the moment. Now my
assistant is going to enter and ask them if
they'd mind waiting another half-hour.
As Spengler, Dana, and the research team watch, the assistant enters the
waiting room and tells the couple about the new delay. They explode
with anger both at him and each other while Spengler monitors them
through the glass. After recording his readings, he returns to his
Assistant.
SPENGLER
We'll do the happiness index next.
(to Dana)
I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if
it's all right with you.
DANA
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
SPENGLER
Oh no.
DANA
(affectedly casual)
Do you ever see him?
SPENGLER
Occasionally
DANA
How is he these days?
SPENGLER
Venkman? I think he was borderline for a
while there. Then he crossed the border.
DANA
Does he ever mention me?
SPENGLER
No. Not that I can recall.
They move to another two-way mirror through which they can see a lovely
little girl playing with a wonderful array of toys.
DANA
(slightly disappointed)
Well, we didn't part on very good terms and
we sort of lost track of each other when I
got married.
The Assistant interrupts again.
ASSISTANT
We're ready for the affection test.
SPENGLER
(to the assistant)
Good. Send in the puppy.
DANA
(continuing)
I thought of calling him after my marriage
ended, but --. Anyway, I appreciate you're
doing this, Egon
They watch as another assistant enters the playroom with an adorable
Cocker Spaniel puppy and gives it to the little girl. Spengler monitors
her as she jumps for joy and hugs the little dog.
DANA
(handing him a card)
This is my address and telephone number.
Will you call me?
SPENGLER
Certainly.
DANA
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of
this to Peter if you don't mind.
SPENGLER
I won't.
DANA
Thank you.
She shakes his hand and exits.
SPENGLER
(to his assistant)
Now let's see how she reacts when we take
away the puppy
CUT TO:
EXT. RAY'S OCCULT BOOK STORE - DAY (LATER)
It's a small basement shop located on a quaint commercial block in
Greenwich Village. The window is crowded with occult artifacts and old
books full of arcane metaphysical lore. The TELEPHONE RINGS.
STANTZ
(v.o., answering the phone)
Ray's Occult.
INT. RAY'S OCCULT BOOKS - CONTINUOUS
The shelves are jammed floor to ceiling with books on the paranormal.
Ray sits on a barstool behind the counter wearing an old cardigan
sweater over a T-shirt. He has on a pair of reading glasses and chews
on a battered, reeking pipe. As he talks on the phone he prepares a cup
of herb tea for Spengler who is thumbing through an arcane text.
STANTZ
(on the phone)
Yeah ... mmhmm ... What do you need? ... What
have I got? I've got alchemy, astrology,
apparitions, Bundu Magic Men, demon
intercession, U.F.O. abductions, psychic
surgery, stigmata, modern miracles, pixie
sightings, golden geese, geists, ghosts, I've
got it all -- what are you looking for? ...
Don't have any. Try the stockyards.
He hangs up.
SPENGLER
Who was that?
STANTZ
Some crank. Looking for goat hooves. Come
up with anything?
SPENGLER
(referring to the book)
This one's interesting. Berlin, 1939, a
flower cart took off by itself and rolled
approximately half a kilometer over level
ground. Three hundred eyewitnesses.
STANTZ
You might want to check those Duke University
mean averaging studies on controlled
psychokinesis.
SPENGLER
(going to the stacks)
Good idea.
The bones hanging over the door rattle as Venkman enters the shop.
VENKMAN
Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me. I'm
looking for an aerosol love potion I could
spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would
make her unconditionally submit to an unusual
personal request.
STANTZ
Oh, hiya, Pete.
VENKMAN
So, no goat hooves, huh?
STANTZ
(strung)
I knew that voice sounded familiar. What's
up? How's it going?
VENKMAN
Nowhere -- fast. Why don't you lock up and
buy me a sub?
STANTZ
(slightly evasive)
Uh, I can't. I'm kind of working on something.
Spengler steps out of the stacks.
VENKMAN
Egon!
SPENGLER
Hello, Venkman.
VENKMAN
How've you been? How's teaching? I bet
those science chicks really dig that big
cranium of yours, huh?
SPENGLER
I think they're more interested in my
epididymis.
VENKMAN
I don't even want to know where that is.
Venkman steps behind the counter and takes a beer from Ray's mini-fridge.
STANTZ
Oh, your book came in, Venkman. Magical
Paths to Fortune and Power.
He hands Venkman the book.
VENKMAN
Great.
(reading the contents)
So what are you guys working on?
STANTZ
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
VENKMAN
Who?
STANTZ
(at a loss)
Who? Just -- someone we know.
VENKMAN
Oh, Ray --
He grabs Stantz by both ears and pulls up.
VENKMAN
Who? Who? Who?
STANTZ
Aaah! Nobody! I can't tell you!
VENKMAN
Who, Ray?
STANTZ
(giving in)
Dana! Dana Barrett!
Venkman lets go of his ears and smiles. Spengler looks at Stantz and
shakes his head.
CUT TO:
INT. DANA'S APARTMENT - DAY (LATER)
The apartment is old and creatively furnished with a comfortable mix of
modern and traditional pieces. Maria, a young Hispanic woman who does
day care for Dana, is feeding the baby in the kitchen when the DOORBELL
RINGS.
CUT TO:
Dana enters from the bedroom and crosses to the front door. She opens
it and admits Ray and Egon.
DANA
(hugging Ray)
Hi, Ray. It's good to see you. Thanks for
coming.
STANTZ
No problem. Always glad to help -- and hug.
DANA
(to Spengler)
Hi, Egon.
She shakes his hand and is about to close the door when Venkman appears
in the doorway.
VENKMAN
Hi, Dana.
Dana is caught completely off guard by Venkman's surprise appearance.
VENKMAN
I knew you'd come crawling back to me.
She regards him coolly, as always amused and amazed at his
presumptuousness.
DANA
Hello, Peter.
VENKMAN
(to Dana)
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you
didn't call me first. I'm still into all
this stuff, you know. Haven't you ever seen
my show?
DANA
I have. That's why I didn't call you first.
VENKMAN
I can see that you're still very bitter about
us, but in the interest of science, I'm going
to give it my best shot. Let's go to work,
boys.
Stantz and Spengler begin a comprehensive parapsychological work-up on
the baby and the immediate physical environment.
VENKMAN AND DANA
Venkman starts nosing around the apartment. Dana follows him.
VENKMAN
So what happened to Mr. Right? I hear he
ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.
DANA
He didn't ""ditch"" me. We had some problems,
he got a good offer from an orchestra in
England and he took it.
VENKMAN
He ditched you. You should've married me,
you know.
DANA
You never asked me, and every time I brought
it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
VENKMAN
Men are very sensitive, you know. We need to
feel loved and desired, too.
DANA
Well, when you started introducing me as ""the
old ball and chain,"" that's when I left.
VENKMAN
I may have a few personal problems but one thing
I am is a total professional.
He leaves her and crosses to Spengler.
SPENGLER
He's taking a complete set of body and head measurements of the baby
with a tape measure and calipers.
VENKMAN
What are you going to do, Egon? Knit him a
snowsuit?
Spengler ignores the remark and hands Venkman a specimen jar.
SPENGLER
I'd like to have a stool specimen
VENKMAN
Yeah, you would. Is that for personal or
professional reasons?
VENKMAN
(picking up the baby)
Okay, kid. Up you go.
He starts clowning with the baby, holding him over his head and pressing
his nose into the baby's belly, pretending that the baby is attacking
him.
VENKMAN
Help! Please somebody help me! Get him off!
Quickly! He's gone completely berserk!
Dana is amused and somewhat disarmed by Venkman's rapport with the baby.
DANA
What do you think?
VENKMAN
There's no doubt about it. He's got his
father's looks. The kid is ugly -- extremely
ugly. And smelly.
(resumes playing with the baby)
You stink! It's just horrible. You are the
stinkiest baby I ever smelled.
(to Dana)
What's his name?
DANA
His name is Oscar.
VENKMAN
Oscar! You poor kid!
DANA
(losing patience)
Peter, this is serious. I need to know if you
think there's anything unusual about him.
VENKMAN
Unusual?
(holds up the baby and
scrutinizes him)
I don't know. I haven't had a lot of
experience with babies.
He looks at the baby, pulling his feet up, trying to get the sleeper
off.
DANA
(taking the specimen jar)
I'll do it.
VENKMAN
I'll supervise.
INT. DANA'S APARTMENT - NURSERY - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
Venkman enters and finds Stantz monitoring the room.
VENKMAN
(to Stantz)
Well, Holmes, what do you think?
STANTZ
It's an interesting one, Pete. If anything
was going on it's totally subdued now.
Spengler enters.
VENKMAN
(to Spengler)
What now, Brainiac?
SPENGLER
I think we should see if we can find
anything abnormal on the street.
VENKMAN
Finding something abnormal on the street
shouldn't be too hard.
CUT TO:
EXT. EAST 77TH STREET - DAY (LATER)
Dana walks down the street with Venkman, retracing the path of the
runaway buggy. Spengler and Stantz follow, monitoring PKE valences from
the pavement and the buildings.
VENKMAN
(to Dana, nostalgic)
Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't
it?
(pointing out familiar
neighborhood sights)
There's our old cash machine. And the dry
cleaners we used to go to. And the old
video store.
(he wipes away an imaginary
tear)
We really had some good times, didn't we?
DANA
We definitely had a moment or two.
Dana stops at the intersection and points to the middle of the street.
DANA
That's where the buggy stopped.
VENKMAN
Okay, let's take a look.
Venkman walks right out into the middle of the street, completely
oblivious to the CARS HONKING and whizzing past him and starts motioning
like a traffic cop, bringing traffic to a standstill. Then he signals
for Dana, Stantz and Spengler to join him in the middle of the street.
STANTZ
(reading the PKE meter)
Is this the spot?
DANA
A little to the left. Right there! That's
where it stopped.
Stantz reads the PKE meter.
STANTZ
Nothing. Not a trace.
SPENGLER
Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
VENKMAN
What's that?
STANTZ
Egon and I have been working on a gauge to
measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs -
giga electron volts.
SPENGLER
That's a thousand million electron volts.
VENKMAN
I knew that.
Spengler switches on the Giga-meter, the device he was testing in the
lab, and passes it over the spot on the street where the buggy stopped.
The indicator goes right into the red zone and the DEVICE starts CLICKING
WILDLY.
STANTZ
I think we hit the honeypot, boys. There's
something brewing under the street.
DANA
(worried, to Venkman)
Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic
problem or something that makes me vulnerable
to these supernatural things.
VENKMAN
You mean like the time you got possessed and
turned into a monster terror dog? No, not
a chance. Total coincidence.
(to Stantz and Spengler)
Am I right?
Stantz and Spengler look at him skeptically, not convinced by the
coincidence theory.
CUT TO:
INT. MANHATTAN MUSEUM OF ART - LATE AFTERNOON
The museum has just closed for the day and the last of the visitors and
employees are leaving.
INT. RESTORATION STUDIO - SAME TIME
Janosz is working late on the painting of Vigo.
VIGO PAINTING
Unnoticed by Janosz, the eyes of Vigo start to glow.
JANOSZ
He touches his brush to the canvas and a powerful current of red,
crackling energy surges through the brush and courses through his body,
driving him to his knees.
PAINTING
The figure of Vigo comes to life, turns toward Janosz and gestures
dramatically at him. Then he speaks to Janosz in a commanding voice.
VIGO
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the
sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
JANOSZ
(in agony)
Command me, lord.
VIGO
On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain,
I sat on a throne of blood. What was will
be, what is will be no more. Now is the
season of evil. Find me a child that I might
live again.
Bolts of red-hot energy shoot from the eyes of Vigo into Janosz's eyes.
He screams and falls to his knees.
CUT TO:
EXT. COFFEE SHOP - EAST 77TH STREET - NIGHT
Venkman and Stantz come out with small boxes containing coffee,
sandwiches and Danish and start walking up the street.
VENKMAN
I love this. We're onto something really
big. I can smell it, Ray. We're going to
make some headlines with this one.
STANTZ
Hey, hey, hey, stresshound! Are you nuts?
If anybody found out about this we'd be in
serious trouble. The judge couldn't have
been clearer - no ghostbusting.
VENKMAN
Relax. We're going to keep this whole thing
nice and quiet, low key, no profile.
EXT. EAST 77TH STREET - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
Spengler, wearing a hardhat, is JACKHAMMERING a hole in the middle of the
street. Safety cones and reflectors have been set up and a small area is
lit by strong work lights.
POLICE CAR
It turns onto East 77th Street, cruises slowly up to the makeshift
worksite and stops. The noise of the JACKHAMMER is so loud, Spengler
doesn't notice the police car and the two COPS inside looking at them.
Finally, he looks up, sees the police car and freezes.
FIRST COP
How ya doing?
SPENGLER
(reeking with guilt)
Fine! It's cutting fine now.
FIRST COP
(curious)
Why are you cutting?
SPENGLER
(looking for one of the
others)
Why are we cutting? Uh - boss!
Venkman and Stantz arrive just in time wearing Con Ed hardhats, doing a
good imitation of a Consolidated Edison repairman.
FIRST COP
What are you doing here?
VENKMAN
(belligerent)
What the hell's it look like we're doing?
We're bustin out asses over here cause
some douchebag downtown ain't got nothin'
better to do than make idiots like us work
late on a Friday night, right?
(looks to Spengler for
agreement)
SPENGLER
(with a ""right on"" fist)
Yo.
The cops seem satisfied by the explanation.
FIRST COP
Okay, boys, take it easy.
They drive off. Spengler breathes a great sigh of relief and starts
rubbing his sore shoulders.
SPENGLER
You were supposed to help me with this.
VENKMAN
You need the exercise.
Stantz resumes JACKHAMMERING, while Venkman and Spengler clear the
rubble from the hole. Suddenly he hits metal. They clear away
generations of paving material revealing an ornate iron manhole cover.
The manhole cover bears a strange logo and the letters NYPRR.
STANTZ
(examing it)
NYPRR. What the hell -- ? Help me lift
this.
They prey off the iron cover with crowbars, uncovering a very dark and
very deep abyss.
STANTZ
(shining a flashlight into
the hole)
Wow! It's an old airshaft. It just goes
forever.
Spengler leans in with the giga-meter which is reading even higher now.
SPENGLER
Very intense. We need a deeper reading.
Somebody has to go down there.
Venkman and Spengler both look at Ray.
STANTZ
Thanks, boys.
They snap Stantz into a harness and lower him into the hole on a strong
cable attached to a winch. Ray calls out orders to them as he descends
deeper and deeper.
STANTZ (O.S.)
(his voice echoing in the
airshaft)
Keep going -- more -- more --
INT. HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
Stantz rappels off the sides of the airshaft as he continues his descent
in total darkness.
STANTZ
(using a radio now)
Lower -- lower --
(to himself)
Gee, this really is deep.
Suddenly, his feet kick thin air as he gets to the bottom of the airshaft
and swings free in some kind of tunnel.
STANTZ
(shouts)
Hold it! Steady!
He pulls a powerful flashlight from his utility belt and shines it into
the tunnel below.
INT. VAN HORNE STATION - STANTZ'S POV - NIGHT
He is suspended near the top of a beautifully preserved chamber with
rounded, polished tile walls ardorned with intricate, colorfully enameled
Art Nouveau mosaics. A finely inlaid sign identifies it as VAN HORNE
STATION.
STANTZ
He pans the walls with his flashlight, admiring the excellent tilework,
and speaks quietly to Venkman and Spengler over his walkie-talkie.
STANTZ
(reverently)
This is it, boys, the end of the line. Van
Horne Station. The old New York Pneumatic.
It's still here.
EXT. EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
Venkman has no idea what he's talking about.
SPENGLER
(explaining)
The New York Pneumatic Railway. It was an
experimental subway system. Fan-forced
air-trains, built around 1870.
STANTZ
(over the walkie-talkie)
This is about as deep as you can go under
Manhattan without digging your own hole.
SPENGLER
(to Stantz)
What's the reading?
INT. VAN HORNE STATION - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
Stantz shines his flashlight on the meter and whistles at the extremely
high reading.
STANTZ
(on the radio)
Off the top of the scale. This place is
really hot. Lower me to the floor.
As Venkman and Spengler feed him some more cable, he pans his flashlight
down the wall of the station, then onto the floor.
STANTZ
(shouts)
Hold it!! Stop!! Whoa!!
INT. VAN HORNE STATION - STANTZ'S POV - FLOOR - NIGHT
Below him is a river of bubbling seething, glowing slime, a veritable
torrent of disgusting ooze.
As he stares into the foul effluent, we become aware of the strangely
amplified and magnified sounds of great ENGINES THROBBING and pulsing in
the bowels of the city, of WATER RUSHING through pipes, STEAM HISSING
through ducts, the muffled RUMBLE of the SUBWAY and the ROAR of TRAFFIC,
and mixed with it all, the unmistakable sounds of human conflict and pain
-- VOICES SHOUTING in anger, SCREAMING in fear, GROANING in pain, a sad
and eerie symphony.
INT. VAN HORNE STATION - STANTZ - NIGHT
STANTZ
(ranting on the radio)
Oh, my God! It's a seething, bubbling,
psychic cess! Interlocked tubes of plasm,
crackling with negative GEVs! It's glowing
and moving! It's -- it's a river of slime!!
STANTZ
He dangles from the end of the cable, holding his feet up as high as he
can. He unhooks a device from his utility belt and pulls the trigger on
it, shooting out a long telescoping fishing-pole with a scoop on the end.
Reaching down, he scoops up a sample of the slime and starts retracting
the pole.
SLIME
Suddenly, a grotesque arm with a long skeletal fingers reaches up out of
the slime and snatches at Stantz's dangling feet. He jerks his legs up
as several more arms poke up out of the slime and reach for him.
STANTZ
(on the radio)
Haul me up, Venkman! Now!
EXT. EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
Venkman and Spengler start hauling in the cable as a Con Ed Supervisor's
car drives up, and behind it, the same police car they saw earlier. A
burly SUPERVISOR gets out and crosses toward them, followed by the two
cops.
SUPERVISOR
(no nonsense)
Okay, what's the story here?
Venkman and Spengler stop pulling up the cable and Venkman tries the
belligerent worker ploy again, only this time he's wearing a Nynex
hardhat.
VENKMAN
What, I got time for this? We got three
thousand phones out in the Village and about
eight million miles of cable to check.
SUPERVISOR
(not buying it)
The phone lines are over there.
(points to the curb)
Venkman pops Spengler on the head.
VENKMAN
I told ya!
Stantz can be heard ranting over Venkman's walkie-talkie.
STANTZ (O.S.)
(filtered)
Help! Help! Pull me up! It's alive! It's
eating my boots.
Venkman switches off the walkie-talkie.
FIRST COP
You ain't with Con Ed or the phone company.
We checked. Tell me another one.
Venkman stares at the Cop for a long moment.
VENKMAN
Gas leak?
INT. VAN HORNE STATION - SAME TIME
Stantz is hanging there, looking down into the shaft at the slime which
is now bubbling up the shaft after him.
STANTZ
(shouting)
Get me out of here!!
Desperate now, he kicks wildly and knocks loose a section of an old,
rusting conduit.
INT. VAN HORNE STATION - BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT
The conduit falls on a heavy electrical transmission line, ripping
through the cable with a SHOWER OF SPARKS.
EXT. EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Venkman, Spengler, the cops and the supervisor all react to a bright
FLASH deep down in the hole and a SHOUT from Stantz.
EXT. EAST 77TH STREET - STREET - NIGHT
One by one, all the streetlights go out; then the lights on all the
buildings along East 77th street; then the whole neighborhood blacks
out, and finally the entire city is plunged into darkness.
STANTZ (O.S.)
Sorry.
INT. DANA BARRETT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
She walks around in the dark lighting candles and placing them all over
the living room. Then she finds a transistor radio and turns it on for
information about the blackout. She listens to a special news report
for a moment, then has a compelling impulse to go check on the baby.
She crosses to the nursery carrying a candle and quietly opens the door
and looks in. Suddenly the DOORBELL RINGS, scaring her half to death.
Leaving the chain on the door, she opens it a crack and sees Janosz
standing in the hall, eerily lit by a red emergency spot at the end of
the hallway. He looks slightly dazed and even creepier.
DANA
(surprised)
Janosz?
JANOSZ
Hello, Dana. I happened to be in the
neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to
see if everything's all right with you --
you know, with the blackout and everything?
Are you okay? Is the baby all right?
His affected concern is chilling. She is frightened but conceals it
from him.
DANA
(mechanically and cautiously)
We're fine, Janosz.
He tires to look around her into the apartment.
JANOSZ
Do you need anything? You want me to come
in?
DANA
No, everything's fine. Honestly. Thanks
anyway.
JANOSZ
Okay, just thought I'd check. Good night,
Dana. Sleep well. Don't let the bedbugs
bite you.
DANA
Good night, Janosz.
She closes the door behind him and double locks it, then stands there
staring into the candlelight, alone and afraid.
INT. HALLWAY OF DANA'S BUILDING - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
Janosz stands there in semi-darkness, then his eyes light up like
headlights and he walks off down the hall.
CUT TO:
INT. COURTROOM - WITNESS STAND - NEXT DAY
The JUDGE, a rather sour-looking jurist of the old school, calls the
court to order.
JUDGE
I want to make one thing very clear before
we go any further. The law does not recognize
the existence of ghosts, and I don't believe
in them either, so I don't want to hear a
lot of malarkey about goblins and spooks and
demons. We're going to stick to the facts
in this case and save the ghost stories for
the kiddies. Understood?
DEFENSE TABLE
Stantz leans over and whispers to Spengler.
STANTZ
Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
SPENGLER
His nickname is ""The Hammer.""
Stantz and Spengler are seated with their attorney LOUIS TULLY, lawyer,
CPA and former demonic possession victim. Louis is desperately paging
through a mountain of legal textbooks.
LOUIS
(nervous)
I think you're making a big mistake here,
fellas. I do mostly tax law and some probate
stuff occasionally. I got my law degree at
night school.
STANTZ
That's all right. We got arrested at night.
SPECTATORS' GALLERY
Venkman is talking to Dana at the wooden rail in front of the gallery.
DANA
I wish I could stay. I feel personally
responsible for you being here.
VENKMAN
You are personally responsible. If I can
get conjugal rights, will you visit me at
Sing Sing?
DANA
Please don't say that. You won't go to prison.
VENKMAN
Don't worry about me. I'm like a cat.
DANA
You mean you cough up hairballs all over
the rug?
VENKMAN
I'm El Gato. I always land on my feet.
DANA
(sincerely)
Good luck.
VENKMAN
Thanks.
She gives him a quick, unexpected kiss and exits. Venkman savors it for
a moment then goes back to the defense table.
PROSECUTION TABLE
Jack Hardemeyer, the mayor's principal aide, is goading the PROSECUTOR,
a very sober, humorless woman in her late thirties.
HARDEMEYER
How are you doing, hon? Just put these guys
away fast and make sure they go away for a
long, long time.
PROSECUTOR
It shouldn't be hard with this list of charges.
HARDEMEYER
Good. Very good. The mayor and future
governor won't forget this.
He smiles conspiratorially and makes a point of passing the defense table
on his way out of the courtroom.
DEFENSE TABLE
The Ghostbusters look up as Hardemeyer approaches.
HARDEMEYER
(gloating)
Nice going, Venkman. Violating a judicial
restraining order, willful destruction of
public property, fraud, malicious mischief
-- smooth move. See you in a couple years
-- at your first parole hearing.
Herdemeyer exits. Louis looks devastated.
LOUIS
Gee, the whole city's against us. I think
I'm going to be sick.
Spengler hands him a waste basket as the Prosecutor calls her first
witness.
INT. COURTROOM - WITNESS STAND - DAY (LATER)
The Con Ed Supervisor is testifying.
PROSECUTOR
Mr. Fianella, please look at Exhibits A
through F on the table over there. Do you
recognize that equipment?
EXHIBIT TABLE
Lying on the table are the basic tools of the Ghostbusting trade: three
proton packs and particle throwers, a couple of ghost traps, and various
meters and detection devices.
CON ED
(o.c.)
That's the stuff the cops found in their
truck.
WITNESS STAND
She continues.
PROSECUTOR
Do you know what this equipment is used for?
CON ED
(shrugs)
I don't know. Catching ghosts, I guess.
PROSECUTOR
(to the Judge)
May I remind the court that the defendants
are under a judicial restraining order that
specifically forbids them from performing
services as paranormal investigators and
eliminators.
JUDGE
So noted.
PROSECUTOR
Now, Mr. Fianella, can you identify the
substance in the jar on the table marked
Exhibit F?
PROSECUTOR
She goes to the exhibit table and picks up a specimen jar containing the
slime sample Stantz removed from the tunnel.
CON ED
I been working underground for Con Ed for
27 years and I never saw anything like that
in my life. We checked out that tunnel the
next day and we didn't find nothing. If it
was down there, they must have put it there.
DEFENSE TABLE
Venkman and Spengler look at Stantz.
STANTZ
(defensively)
Hey, I didn't imagine it. There must have
been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
SPENGLER
It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal
source.
LOUIS
(nervously)
Should I say that?
SPENGLER
I doubt that they'd believe us.
Louis moans and goes back to his notes.
WIPE TO:
INT. COURTROOM - WITNESS STAND - LATER
Venkman himself is on the stand and Louis is questioning him.
LOUIS
So like you were just trying to help out
your old friend because she was scared and
you didn't really mean to do anything bad
and you really love the city and won't ever
do anything like this again, right?
PROSECUTOR
Objection, your Honor. He's leading the
witness.
JUDGE
The witness is leading him. Sustained.
LOUIS
Okay, let me rephrase that question.
(to venkman)
Didn't you once coach a basketball team for
underprivileged children?
VENKMAN
Yes, I did. We were city champs.
PROSECUTOR
Objection. Irrelevant and immaterial.
JUDGE
Sustained. Mr. Tully, do you have anything
to ask this witness that may have some
bearing on this case?
LOUIS
(to Venkman)
Do I?
VENKMAN
No, I think you've helped them enough already.
LOUIS
(to the Judge)
No, I guess not.
(to the Prosecutor)
Your witness.
The Prosecutor rises and approaches the witness stand with relish.
PROSECUTOR
So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court
why it is you and your co-defendants took it
upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the
middle of the street.
VENKMAN
Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many
holes already we didn't think anyone would
notice.
The gallery laughs and the Judge gavels for order.
JUDGE
Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in
contempt.
VENKMAN
Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets
me up like that I can't resist.
PROSECUTOR
I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman. Why were
you digging the hole? And please remember
that you're under oath.
VENKMAN
I had my fingers crossed when they swore me
in, but I'm going to tell you the truth.
There are things in this world that go way
beyond human understanding, things that
can't be explained and that most people don't
want to know about anyway. That's where we
come in.
PROSECUTOR
So what are you saying? That the world of
the supernatural is your special province?
VENKMAN
No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens
and somebody has to deal with it.
The spectators in the gallery cheer and the judge gavels for order.
WIPE TO:
INT. COURTROOM - LATER
The trial is nearing its end. The Judge calls on Louis to make his
summation.
JUDGE
Does the counsel for the defense wish to
make any final arguements?
Louis rises.
LOUIS
Your honor, may I approach the bench?
JUDGE
(impatient)
Yes.
Louis crosses to the judge's bench.
LOUIS
(to the judge)
Can I have some of your water?
JUDGE
Get on with it, counselor!
LOUIS
(scared)
Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the --
(he remembers there's no
jury)
audience. I don't think it's fair to call
my clients frauds. Okay, the blackout was
a big problem for everybody. I was stuck in
an elevator for about three hours and I had
to go to the bathroom the whole time, but I
don't blame them because once I turned into
a dog and they helped me. Thank you.
He goes back to the defense table and sits down. Stantz and Spengler
hang their heads. Venkman pats Louis on the back.
SPENGLER
(to Louis)
Way to go. Concise and to the point.
JUDGE
He stares at Louis, astonished at his summation.
JUDGE
That's it? That's all you have to say?
LOUIS
Did I forget something?
He searches through a disorderly pile of notes.
JUDGE
That was unquestionably the worst
presentation of a case I've ever heard in a
court of law! I ought to cite you for
contempt and have you disbarred. As for
your clients, Peter Venkman, Raymond Stantz
and Egon Spengler, on the charges of
conspiracy, fraud and the willful destruction
of public property, I find you guilty on all
counts. I order you to pay fines in the
amount of $25,000 each and I sentence you to
eighteen months in the city correctional
facility at Ryker's Island.
STANTZ
He sees the activity in the jar
STANTZ
Uh-oh, she's twitchin'.
THE BENCH
The Judge continues
JUDGE
And on a more personal note, let me go on
record as saying that there is no place in
decent society for fakes, charlatans and
tricksters like you who prey on the
gullibility of innocent people. You're
beneath the contempt of this court. And
believe me, if my hands were not tied by the
unalterable fetters of the law, a law which
has become in my view far too permissive and
inadequate in it's standards of punishment,
I would invoke the tradition of our
illustrious forebearers, reach back to a
sterner, purer justice and have you burned
at the stake!
He hammers the bench with his gravel as the gallery erupts noisily. Then
he feels a LOW RUMBLING TREMOR in the courtroom.
SPECIMEN JAR
The slime starts to pulse and swell, pushing up the lid on the jar.
DEFENSE TABLE
Stantz anticipates big trouble.
STANTZ
Under the table, boys!
The Ghostbusters duck under the defense table.
LOUIS
He stands up and looks around fearfully.
INT. COURTROOM - GHOST BATTLE - DAY
Everybody is silent now as the rumbling increases. All eyes turn to the
exhibit table. Then suddenly all Hell breaks loose as TWO FULL-TORSO
APPARITIONS explode out of the specimen jar.
JUDGE
He looks up in terror at the two huge apparitions looming above him and
recognizes them immediately.
JUDGE
(in horror)
Oh, my God! The Scoleri Brothers!
SCOLERI BROTHERS
Big in life, even bigger in death, the ghostly Scoleri brothers seem ten
feet tall. They are strapped into electric chairs and on their heads are
metal electrocution caps with live, sparking electrical wires still
attached. Twenty-five hundred volts of electricity shoot through their
bodies as they start to break free of the leather restraints, trying to
get at the Judge.
JUDGE
Holding his gavel like a pitiful weapon, he crawls over to the defense
table where Venkman, Stantz and Spengler are now crouched, assessing the
spectral intruders.
JUDGE
(terrified)
You've got to do something!
VENKMAN
Who are they?
JUDGE
They're the Scoleri Brothers. I tried them
for murder. They were electrocuted up at
Ossining in '48. Now they want to kill me.
VENKMAN
Maybe they just want to appeal.
SCOLERI BROTHERS
They break loose from the electric chairs, then turn toward the defense
table and BLAST it with HIGH-VOLTAGE FINGER-LIGHTNING.
PROSECUTOR
She sprints for the door, pursued by one of the Scoleri brothers.
GHOSTBUSTERS
They jump to safety behind the rail of the jury box, pulling the Judge
with them.
VENKMAN
These boys aren't playing around.
JUDGE
(desperately)
You've got to stop them. Please!
LOUIS
(thinking like a lawyer)
Violating a judicial restraining order could
expose my clients to serious criminal
penalties. As their attorney I'd have to
advise them against it.
SCOLERI BROTHERS
They start punching through the jury box.
JUDGE
He is just about hysterical with fear.
JUDGE
All right! All right! I'm recinding the
order. Case dismissed!!
(he pounds his gavel on
the floor)
Now do something!
STANTZ
Let's go to work, boys.
With that, the Ghostbusters leap over the rail of the jury box and dash
across the courtroom to the exhibit table where their proton packs were
being displayed as evidence. They strap them on hastily as the Brothers
continue tearing up the seats looing for the Judge.
VENKMAN
(slinging the pack onto
his back)
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
STANTZ
(grabbing other gear)
Okay, let's heat 'em up!
They flip the power switches on their packs and draw their particle
throwers.
STANTZ
All right, throwers. Set for full neutronas
on stream.
They switch on their throwers and turn to face the raging phantasms.
SCOLERI BROTHERS
They are just about to wipe out the Judge when a loud shout distracts
them.
VENKMAN
Hey! Why don't you pick on someone your own
size?
The towering ghosts turn in a fury and raise their arms, ready to shoot
lightning at their new adversaries.
STANTZ
(to the others)
On my signal, boys. Open 'em up -- Now!
They all pull their triggers and the wands EXPLODE with incredible
powerful STREAMS OF ENERGY, doing even more damage to the courtroom.
VENKMAN
Spengs, take the door. Ray, let's try and
work them down and into the corner.
Working as a team, they gradually confine the Scoleri Brothers with the
streams, forcing them closer and closer to the traps Ray has set out on
the floor.
STANTZ
Watch it! I'm coming under you, Pete.
They circle around the two ghosts, prodding them with the streams while
ducking the lightning bolts shooting from their fingers. Finally, Ray
sees his chance and pops open the traps which emit inverted pyramids of
light energy.
STANTZ
Steady -- watch your streams -- easy now --
Venky, bring him left -- Spengy, pull him
down -- trapping -- trapping -- now!
He stomps on a control pedal and the Scoleri Brothers are drawn into the
traps which snap shut.
INT. COURTROOM - TRAPS - DAY
LEDs on the outer casing start flashing, indicating the presence of a
ghost inside each trap.
VENKMAN
(checking the trap)
Occupado.
INT. COURTROOM - JUDGE - DAY (AFTER GHOST BATTLE)
He sticks his head up slowly from behind the debris of his bench and
looks around in total amazement.
LOUIS
He crawls out from under a chair. Reporters and spectators get back on
their feet and start buzzing about the incredible manifestation.
PROSECUTOR
She's lying on the floor, attended to by the Bailiff and the Court Clerk.
SPENGLER
(to the Prosecutor)
Brilliant summation.
GHOSTBUSTERS
They break into big smiles as photographers start snapping pictures of
them standing in the wrecked courtroom.
VENKMAN
Case closed, boys. We're back in business.
The spectators cheer and applaud.
CUT TO:
EXT. FIREHOUSE - DAY
The old, dilapidated Ghostbusters logo comes crashing to the ground,
dropped by a pair of workmen on a ladder, and the new logo is hoisted
into place over the main entrance. It's just like the original ""No
Ghosts"" logo, but in the new one the ghost in the red circle is holding
up two fingers. Venkman enters the firehouse.
INT. BEDROOM SET (TV COMMERCIAL - FULL SCREEN VIDEO) - NIGHT
A man and his wife are lying in bed reading. The man is played by Louis
Tully and JANINE MELNITZ, the Ghostbusters' once and future receptionist,
is playing his wife. They are both terrible actors. Suddenly, a ghost,
actually a very bad puppet on a wire, floats through the bedroom. Janine
sees it and screams.
LOUIS
What is it, honey?
JANINE
It's that darn ghost again! I don't know
what to do anymore. He just won't leave us
alone. I guess we'll just have to move.
LOUIS
Don't worry. We're not moving. He is.
He picks up the phone.
JANINE
Who are you going to call?
LOUIS
(with a wink)
Ghostbusters.
As he starts to dial, the CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal the Ghostbusters
standing in the bedroom. Their acting isn't much better than Louis and
Janine's.
GHOSTBUSTERS
Stantz speaks directly TO the CAMERA.
STANTZ
I'm Ray --
VENKMAN
I'm Peter --
SPENGLER
I'm Egon --
STANTZ
And we're the ...
ALL
(together)
Ghostbusters.
STANTZ
That's right -- Ghostbusters. We're back
and we're better than ever with twice the
know-how and twice the particle-power to
deal with all your supernatural elimination
needs.
During his speech, Winston can be seen in the b.g. pretending to trap the
fake ghost.
STANTZ
Careful, Winston. He's a mean one.
(TO CAMERA)
And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're
giving you twice the value with our special
half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan.
VENKMAN
Hold on, Ray! Half-price! Have you gone
crazy?
STANTZ
I guess so, Pete, because that's not all.
Tell them what else we've got, Egon.
Spengler actually mouths everyone else's dialogue along with them,
waiting for his cue.
SPENGLER
You mean the Ghostbusters hot beverage
thermal mugs and free balloons for the kids?
He holds up a mug and a limp, uninflated balloon.
STANTZ
You bet.
As Stantz wraps it up, SUPERS APPEAR at the bottom of the SCREEN: FULLY
BONDED - FULLY LICENSED - SE HABLA ESPANOL.
STANTZ
(TO CAMERA)
So don't wait another minute. Make your
supernatural problem our supernatural problem.
Call now, because we're still --
ALL
(in unison, mechanically)
-- Ready to believe you.
CUT TO:
INT. JACK HARDEMEYER'S OFFICE - DAY
Hardemeyer is watching the Ghostbusters commercial on a TV in his office.
He bangs his fist on his desk and angrily switches OFF the TV.
CUT TO:
EXT. FIREHOUSE - DAY (LATER)
The garage door opens and the new improved ECTOMOBILE comes ROARING out
onto the street, its ghostly SIREN MOANING and WAILING. Louis comes
running out after it.
CUT TO:
INT. FIREHOUSE - DAY
Louis comes back into the garage bay and stops as he smells a foul odor.
He sniffs around, following the smell.
LOUIS
Oh, geez, smells like somebody took a really
big --
He freezes.
INT. OFFICE AREA - LOUIS'S POV
Slimer, a spud-like green ghost, is hovering over Louis's desk, scarfing
down Louis's bag lunch. Slimer looks up and sees Louis.
SLIMER AND LOUIS
They both scream and run off in opposite directions.
SLIMER
He passes right through a wall and disappears.
LOUIS
He runs right into a wall, recovers and exits in a hurry.
LOUIS
(screaming)
Help! There's a thing!
CUT TO:
EXT. CENTRAL PARK RESERVOIR - DAY (LATER)
Runners of both sexes and all ages are huffing and puffing as they jog
along the track that circles the reservoir. One of the runners looks
behind him at the sound of APPROACHING FOOTFALLS and screams.
GHOSTLY JOGGER
A ghost jogger is loping along at a pretty fair pace. Other runners
stumble and run screaming into the park as he passes them. Seemingly
oblivious to the effect he's having, the ghost jogger puts two fingers to
his skeletal neck and checks his watch as if taking his pulse.
EXT. CLEARING IN PARK - DAY (SAME TIME)
Venkman is sitting on a park bench near the jogging track reading the
newspaper, eating a donut and drinking coffee from a Styrofoam cup.
STANTZ
He's sitting on a bench opposite Venkman's, casually watching the jogging
track.
GHOST JOGGER
He approaches the benches where the Ghostbusters are waiting. As the
ghost jogger passes the benches, Stantz and Venkman simultaneously hit
concealed control buttons. A ghost trap buried in the track throws up a
glowing inverted pyramid and catches the ghost jogger in mid-stride.
Stantz and Venkman close the trap and capture the ghost jogger.
VENKMAN
(checking his watch)
You know he ran that last lap in under six
minutes?
STANTZ
If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic
prospect.
CUT TO:
EXT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY
The Ghostbusters come out carrying smoking traps, wearing cheap
dime-store Santa Claus hats.
STANTZ
(to the client)
Merry Christmas!
CUT TO:
EXT. FIFTH AVENUE - ORREFORS GLASS STORE - DAY
The Ectomobile is parked at the curb and a curious crowd looks on as the
Ghostbusters enter the store.
INT. ORREFORS GLASS STORE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
All the precious crystal is floating in the air, several feet above the
glass shelves and display tables. Stantz and Venkman are talking to the
manager while Winston and Spengler set up an array of electronic devices
positioned in each corner of the store.
On a signal from Stantz, Spengler and Winston switch on the devices which
throw laser-type beams around the perimeter of the store. The manager
watches in horror as all the GLASSWARE suddenly drops out of the air,
SMASHES through the GLASS SHELVES and SHATTERS on the display tables.
There is a long pregnant pause.
STANTZ
(to the manager)
So will that be cash or a check?
CUT TO:
INT. MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)
Everyone else has gone home. Dana is cleaning her brushes and putting
her supplies away.
VIGO PAINTING - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Vigo turns his head and watches Dana as she walks past the painting.
DANA
She stops, vaguely aware of the movement, and looks up curiously at the
painting. As she starts to walk on, Vigo looks at her again, but Dana
turns suddenly and catches the movement. Frightened now, she hastily
leaves the studio.
INT. FIREHOUSE - DAY
Louis is lurking behind a pillar, peeking out at the office area. We PAN
DOWN TO the floor and see a foot pedal, then PAN ALONG the cord TO a
ghost trap sitting on Louis's desk. Hanging from strings over the desk
are several pieces of Kentucky fried chicken.
WALL
Slimer partially emerges and furtively sniffs the air, then spots the
chicken bait. He licks his lips, materializes completely and flies to
the chicken.
LOUIS
His eyes light up and he stomps the foot pedal.
LOUIS
(shouts)
Gotcha!
DESK
The trap pops open and shoots out a powerful cone of energy. Slimer
dodges it and escapes as a big section of the ceiling comes crashing down
on Louis's desk.
LOUIS
(seeing the damage)
Uh-oh.
He slinks off, defeated.
CUT TO:
INT. MANHATTAN MUSEUM OF ART - SECURITY DESK - DAY
The Ghostbusters commercial is playing on a portable TV on the security
desk. Rudy, the Security Guard, is reading a National Enquirer with a
giant front-page headline: GHOSTBUSTERS SAVE JUDGE. Venkman enters.
VENKMAN
I'm looking for Dana Barrett.
SECURITY GUARD
Room 304 -- Restorations.
(recognizing him)
Hey! Dr. Venkman -- 'World of the Psychic.'
I'm a big, big fan. That used to be one of
my two favorite shows.
VENKMAN
(flattered)
Thanks. What's the other one?
SECURITY GUARD
'Bass Masters.' It's a fishing show. Ever
see it?
VENKMAN
Yeah, really great. Take it easy.
He exits.
INT. MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)
Dana is working on a valuable Flemish still-life by Ver Meer. Janosz is
at the other end of the room, still working on the painting of Vigo.
Venkman enters and sneaks up behind Dana.
VENKMAN
(looking at the Ver Meer)
So this is what you do, huh?
DANA
(glad to see him)
Oh, hello, Peter.
VENKMAN
You're really good, you know.
DANA
I didn't paint it. I'm just cleaning it.
It's an original Ver Meer. It's worth about
ten million dollars.
VIGO
He turns his head and watches Venkman and Dana.
VENKMAN
Unaware that he's being watched, Venkman squints at the still life,
holding up his thumb like he's seen artists do.
VENKMAN
You know you can go to Art World and get
these huge sofa-size paintings for about
forty-five bucks.
He starts looking around at the other artwork in the studio.
DANA
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk
about art.
VENKMAN
As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell
you that I haven't forgotten your problem
and that we're still on the case.
They are interrupted by the sudden appearance of Janosz.
JANOSZ
(smiling at Venkman)
Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to
your friend?
DANA
Oh, I'm sorry. This is Peter Venkman.
Peter, Janosz Poha.
Venkman warily shakes his hand, trying to size him up.
JANOSZ
(avoiding his gaze)
Pleasure to meet you. I've seen you on
television.
VENKMAN
How are you?
(looking over at the Vigo
painting)
What's that you're working on, Johnny?
Janosz winces at the nickname but lets it go. Venkman and Dana cross to
the Vigo painting. Janosz steps protectively in front of it.
JANOSZ
It's a painting I'm restoring for the new
Byzantine exhibition. It's a self-portrait
of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian. He ruled
most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th
Century.
VENKMAN
(staring at the painting)
Too bad for the Moldavians.
JANOSZ
(defensive)
He was a very powerful magician. A genius
in many ways and quite a skilled painter.
DANA
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman.
I hate this painting. I've felt very
uncomfortable since they brought it up from
storage.
VENKMAN
Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want
to hang in the rec room. You know what it
needs?
(picking up a brush)
A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.
Venkman reaches toward the painting, but Janosz grabs his hand.
JANOSZ
(with forced good will)
We don't go around altering valuable
paintings, Dr. Venkman.
VENKMAN
Well, I'd make an exception in this case if
I were you.
Dana looks disapprovingly at Venkman.
VENKMAN
(to Janosz)
I'll let you get back to it. Nice meeting
you.
JANOSZ
My pleasure.
Venkman and Dana cross back to her workspace.
VENKMAN
(confidentially)
I may be wrong, but I think you've got a
little crush on this guy.
DANA
Good-bye, Peter.
VENKMAN
(dragging his feet)
I'd like to stay, but I really don't have
time to hang around here. I'll call you.
(calls out to Janosz)
Later, Johnny!
He exits.
VIGO
Vigo turns his head and follows Dana as she returns to her workbench.
DANA
She stops, vaguely aware of the movement, and looks up curiously at the
painting. As she starts to walk on, Vigo looks at her again, but Dana
turns suddenly and catches the movement. Frightened now, she hastily
leaves the studio.
CUT TO:
INT. FIREHOUSE - LIVING QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY
Venkman and Winston enter and find Stantz and Spengler at work in the lab
area.
STANTZ
Oh good, you're here. Spengler and I have
something really amazing to show you.
VENKMAN
(to Spengler)
It's not that thing you do with your
nostrils, is it?
Stantz goes to the refrigerator, opens the freezer, rummages around among
the TV dinners and frozen pizza and pulls out a slime specimen in a
Tupperware container.
STANTZ
(to Venkman)
We've been studying the stuff that we took
from the subway tunnel.
He pops the specimen jar in the microwave and lets it thaw for a minute.
VENKMAN
And now you're going to eat it?
STANTZ
No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.
He takes the specimen out of the microwave and pours some of it into a
large Petri dish.
STANTZ
Now watch this.
He leans over the specimen and starts shouting at it.
STANTZ
(simulating anger)
You worthless piece of slime!!
(as the slime starts to
twitch and glow)
You ignorant disgusting blob!!
SPECIMEN
It bubbles and swells, changing color with each insult.
STANTZ
You foul, obnoxious muck!!
STANTZ
He continues venting his rage on the slime.
STANTZ
I've seen some real crud in my time, but
you're a chemical disgrace!!
The specimen doubles its size and starts spilling over the rim of the
Petri dish.
STANTZ AND SPENGLER
They turn to Venkman for his reaction. He's dumbfounded.
VENKMAN
This is what you do with your spare time?
STANTZ
(very excited)
This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman.
A psychoreactive substance! Whatever this
is, it clearly responds to human emotional
states.
VENKMAN
'Mood slime.' We ought to bottle this stuff
and sell it.
SPENGLER
We've found it at every event site we've
been to lately.
WINSTON
(poking at the slime)
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad
vibes'?
STANTZ
Like a goat on garbage.
STANTZ
We're running tests to see if we can get an
equally strong positive reaction.
VENKMAN
What kind of tests?
STANTZ
(a little embarrassed)
Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say
supportive, nurturing things --
VENKMAN
You're not sleeping with this stuff, are you?
Spengler reacts as if he might be.
STANTZ
It really responds to music.
(to Spengler)
Let's calm it down.
Spengler picks up a guitar and he and Stantz start singing ""Cumbaya"" to
the slime specimen.
SPECIMEN
It stops bubbling and starts to shrink.
WINSTON
Does it have any favorites?
STANTZ
It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,'
'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small
World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.
Venkman and Winston watch intently as Spengler spoons some of the
psych-reactive slime onto an old toaster.
STANTZ
Watch this.
Stantz turns on a CASSETTE PLAYER and Jackie Wilson's ""HIGHER AND HIGHER""
BLASTS from the speakers.
TOASTER
It shakes, spins and actually starts moving in time with the MUSIC.
VENKMAN
He stares in disbelief at the dancing toaster as it shoots two pieces of
toast into the air and catches them without missing a beat.
VENKMAN
I don't care what you say. This could be a
major Christmas gift item.
WINSTON
Right, and the first time someone gets mad,
their toaster will eat their hand.
VENKMAN
So we'll put a warning on the label.
Stantz turns OFF the MUSIC and the toaster stops moving. Venkman looks
at the toaster and sticks his fingers in the slot.
VENKMAN
(to the toaster)
Go ahead. I dare you.
Suddenly, he yelps as if the toaster has actually bitten into his hand
and won't let go. The others jump in to help him, but Venkman laughs and
easily withdraws his hand.
VENKMAN
Just kidding.
CUT TO:
INT. DANA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Dana brings Oscar into the bathroom and lays him on the bassinet. She's
wearing a robe over her nightgown, preparing to bathe the baby. She
turns the taps on the old claw-footed bathtub, checks the water
temperature, then turns away and starts to undress the baby.
DANA
(talking sweetly to the
baby)
Look at you. I think we got more food on
your shirt than we got in your mouth.
BATHTUB
The water pouring from the faucet changes to slime and settles at the
bottom of the tub. Dana reaches over and turns off the water without
looking into the tub. When she turns away, both taps start to spin by
themselves and the tub flexes and bulges.
DANA
Still unaware, she routinely reaches over and squirts some bubble bath
into the tub.
BATHTUB
The rim of the tub puckers up and the sides convulse as if swallowing the
bubble bath.
DANA
She picks the baby up off the bassinet and turns to place him in the tub.
She is just about to lower him into the water when the tub starts to
close up around the baby like a hugh mouth. Dana screams, snatches the
baby away and runs from the room clutching Oscar to her bosom as the
bathtub convulses and vomits up buckets of slime.
CUT TO:
INT. VENKMAN'S LOFT - SAME NIGHT (LATER)
The big open loft space is a chaotic clutter of mismatched furniture, old
magazines, books, tapes, and sports equipment. Venkman is asleep on the
floor, still wearing his coat, scarf, hat and gloves, having collapsed
just short of the bedroom. The DOORBELL RINGS, he wakes up, lumbers to
his feet and answers it. He opens the door and sees Dana standing there.
She is wearing only a nightgown under her coat and Oscar is naked,
wrapped in a baby blanket.
DANA
(somewhat embarrassed to
be there)
I'm sorry. Were you on your way out?
VENKMAN
(surprised to see her)
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago.
Come on in.
(noting her apparel)
Are we having a pajama party?
DANA
(upset)
Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.
Venkman looks at her for a long moment.
VENKMAN
You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd
have serious doubts. But coming from you,
I can't honestly say I'm surprised.
DANA
I must be losing my mind. At the museum
today I could have sworn that terrible
painting of Vigo looked right at me.
VENKMAN
Who could blame him? Were you wearing this
nightgown?
DANA
(distraught)
I don't know what to do anymore.
VENKMAN
I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the
bathtub. You better stay here.
He exits to the bathroom. She looks around the loft, amazed at the
disorder. Venkman comes back immediately with an old sweatshirt and
takes Oscar from her.
VENKMAN
Now this kid has a serious nudity problem.
He spreads the sweatshirt out on the sofa, lays the baby on it and starts
tying it around him like a diaper.
VENKMAN
(to the baby)
This is Joe Namath's old number, you know.
You could get a lot of chicks with this.
Just don't pee in it.
DANA
Peter, what about the bathtub?
VENKMAN
(grabs the phone and dials)
We'll take care of that.
(on the phone)
Ray, Pete. Listen, get over to Dana's right
away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one --
tried to eat the kid.
DANA
It was full of this awful pink ooze.
VENKMAN
(to Ray)
Sounds like another slime job ... No,
they're all right. They're here now ...
Right ... Let me know.
He hangs up.
VENKMAN
They're going over there right now. You
might as well make yourself at home. Let
me show you around.
(he crosses to the kitchen area)
This is the cuisine de maison --
It's an incredible mess. The sink is piled high with dirty dishes and the
counters are littered with all sorts of food trash. He grabs a big open
Hefty bag on the floor and starts throwing garbage into it.
VENKMAN
(looking at the sink)
We may have to wash some of these if you get
hungry --
(he looks in the fridge)
-- but there's no food anyway so forget
about it. I have all kinds of carry-out
menus if you feel like ordering.
He opens a drawer full of pizza, barbecue and Chinese food menus, then
crosses to the bathroom.
VENKMAN
Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy
up a few things.
DANA
Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have
to do any of this, you know.
He goes into the bathroom and we hear WATER RUNNING, the TOILET FLUSHING
and more items going into the Hefty bag.
VENKMAN (O.S.)
The shower works but it's a little tricky.
They're both marked ""Hot."" It takes a little
practice, but at least this one won't try
and eat you.
He comes out of the bathroom with the now-loaded Hefty bag over his
shoulder.
VENKMAN
Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter.
But the bed's good and I just changed the
sheets so if you get tired, feel free. In
fact, I think you should definitely plan on
spending the night here.
DANA
Really? And how would we handle the sleeping
arrangements?
VENKMAN
For me it's best if I sleep on my side and
you spoon up right behind me with your arms
around me. If we go the other way I'm
afraid your hair will be getting in my face
all night.
DANA
How about you on the sofa and me in bed with
the baby.
VENKMAN
Or we could do that.
DANA
Thank you.
(she picks up Oscar)
Poor baby. I think I should put him down
now.
VENKMAN
I'll put him down for you.
(taking the baby)
You are way too short! And your belly-button
sticks out! You're nothing but a burden to
your poor mother!
Venkman carries the baby into the bedroom leaving Dana in the living
room, feeling more relaxed and a lot safer.
CUT TO:
EXT. MUSEUM - DAY (NEXT MORNING)
Venkman is waiting in front of the building as ECTO-2 pulls up and
Stantz, Spengler and Winston get out and report on Dana's apartment.
VENKMAN
Did you find anything at Dana's?
STANTZ
Nothing. Just some mood-slime residue in
and around the bathtub. But we did turn up
some interesting stuff on this Vigo character
you mentioned. I found the name Vigo the
Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians,
Martyrs and Madmen. Listen to this:
SPENGLER
(reads from xerox of entry)
""Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --""
VENKMAN
A hundred and five years? He really hung
on, didn't he.
STANTZ
And he didn't die of old age either. He was
poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched,
disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
WINSTON
I guess he wasn't too popular at the end
there.
SPENGLER
No, not exactly a man of the people.
(reads)
""Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the
Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the
Unholy.""
STANTZ
This guy was a bad monkey. He dabbled in
all the Black Arts, and listen to this
prophecy. Just before his head died, his
last words were, ""Death is but a door, time
is but a window. I'll be back.""
VENKMAN
That's it? ""I'll be back?""
SPENGLER
It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
They enter the museum carrying their monitoring equipment.
INT. MUSEUM - SECURITY DESK - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
Rudy the guard looks up in surprise as the Ghostbusters enter.
RUDY
Hey, Dr. Venkman. What's going on?
VENKMAN
We're just going up to Restorations for a
minute.
RUDY
Oh, I can't let you do that. Mr. Poha told
me not to let you up there anymore.
VENKMAN
(with mock seriousness)
Okay, we were trying to keep this quiet but
I think you can be trusted. Tell him, Ray.
STANTZ
(very official)
Mister, you have an Ecto-paritic,
subfusionary flux in this building.
RUDY
We got a flux?
WINSTON
You got a flux and a half.
STANTZ
Now if you don't want to be the --
(he counts)
-- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock
from a planar rift, I suggest you get down
behind that desk and don't move until we
give you the signal ""Stabilize -- All Clear.""
Rudy gulps and starts to hunker down behind the desk as the Ghostbusters
head upstairs.
INT. MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)
Janosz is working on the Vigo painting when the Ghostbusters enter. He
rushes over and stops them at the door.
JANOSZ
Dr. Venkman? Dana is not here.
VENKMAN
I know.
JANOSZ
Then why have you come?
VENKMAN
We got a major creep alert and we're just
going down the list. Your name was first.
STANTZ
(to Spengler and Winston)
Let's sweep it, boys.
They deploy and start scanning the studio with their monitoring devices.
VENKMAN
(to Janosz)
You know, I never got to ask you. Where you
from, Johnny?
JANOSZ
(nervous)
The Upper West Side.
SPENGLER
(consulting his PKE meter)
This entire room is extremely hot, Peter.
JANOSZ
What exactly are you looking for, Dr. Venkman?
VENKMAN
We'll know when we find it. You just sit
tight. This won't take long.
STANTZ
Using the Giga-meter, he traces a strong psychomagnetheric reading to
the painting of Vigo in the alcove at the end of the studio. Venkman
comes up behind him with Janosz right on his heels.
VENKMAN
This is the one that looked at Dana.
JANOSZ
It must be the chemical fumes in the studio.
People start imagining things --
VENKMAN
(interrupts)
I'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing
theory. If she says it looked at her, it
looked at her.
(to Vigo)
Hey, you! Vigie! Look at me. I'm talking
to you. Hey! Look at me when I'm talking
to you.
They watch the painting for any sign of movement.
VIGO
His eyes stare lifelessly into the distance.
STANTZ AND VENKMAN
Venkman starts shooting Polaroids of Vigo.
VENKMAN
(to Vigo)
Beautiful, beautiful. Work with me, baby.
Just have fun with it.
(to Stantz)
Okay, he's playing it cool. Let's finish
up and get out of here.
STANTZ
I'll get one more reading.
Venkman walks off leaving Stantz alone with the painting. Stantz scans
the painting with the Giga-meter until his eyes meet Vigo's.
VIGO
His eyes seems to burn right through to the depths of Stantz's soul.
STANTZ
He stands there transfixed, unable to look away, as a strange and subtle
transformation occurs within him. Winston comes up behind him and breaks
the spell.
WINSTON
(looking at the painting)
Now that's one ugly dude.
STANTZ
(coming back to his senses)
Huh? What?
WINSTON
You finished here?
STANTZ
(distracted)
What? Yeah.
WINSTON
Are you all right? You coming down with
something?
STANTZ
No, I'm fine. I just got light-headed for
a second there. Let's go.
They head for the door.
JANOSZ
He escorts the Ghostbusters to the door.
JANOSZ
So you see, everything is in order, is it
not?
VENKMAN
Not. Don't leave town and report any change
in your address to the proper authorities.
We'll be back.
They exit.
CUT TO:
EXT. MUSEUM - DAY (LATER)
The Ghostbusters cross to ECTO-2.
SPENGLER
There's definitely something going on in
that studio. The PKE levels were max-plus
and the Giga-meter was showing all red.
WINSTON
I'd put my money on that Vigo character.
VENKMAN
Yeah, that's a safe bet.
(to Stantz)
You and Spengman see what else you can dig
up on Vigo and this little weasel Poha.
Those two were made for each other.
INT. ECTO-2 - DAY (LATER)
The Ghostbusters are driving back to the firehouse. Stantz is at the
wheel. His eyes are vacant, he seems distracted and very tense. Stantz
swerves suddenly and HONKS the horn angrily.
STANTZ
(to another driver)
Idiot!
(honking)
Move it, you jerk!
Venkman and Winston exchange surprised looks.
EXT. STREET - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
Stantz drives extremely fast, HONKING vindictively, weaving dangerously
through traffic.
INT. ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
Winston looks at Ray, concerned.
WINSTON
Going a little fast, aren't we, Ray?
Stantz turns on him.
STANTZ
(viciously)
Are you telling me how to drive?
WINSTON
No, I just thought --
STANTZ
Well don't think!
He HONKS again and tromps hard on the accelerator.
EXT. STREET - DAY (CONTINUOUS)
Ecto-2 is now barreling down the avenue. Pedestrians leap to safety as
Stantz runs a red light.
INT. ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
They hang on to the safety straps as Stantz continues his maniacal ride.
WINSTON
(to Stantz, really worried
now)
Are you crazy, man? You're going to kill
somebody!
Stantz looks at him and smile demonically.
STANTZ
No, I'm going to kill everybody!
He swerves off the road.
EXT. ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
The car heads right for a big tree.
INT. ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
At the last possible moment, Winston cold-cocks Stantz, grabs the wheel
and steps across to stomp on the brakes.
EXT. ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
The car skids into the tree and stops. The Ghostbusters stumble out
dazed and shaken, but unhurt. Stantz rubs his eyes and looks at the
others, completely at a loss.
STANTZ
(himself again)
What happened?
VENKMAN
You just picked up three penalty points on
your driver's license.
WINSTON
Are you all right?
STANTZ
Yeah, I guess so. It was the strangest
thing. I knew what I was doing but I
couldn't stop. This really terrible feeling
came over me and -- I don't know -- I just
felt like driving into that tree and ending
it all. Whew! Sorry, boys.
They inspect the damage to the car.
VENKMAN
(confidentially, to
Spengler)
Watch him, Egon. Don't even let him shave.
CUT TO:
INT. VENKMAN'S LOFT - DAY (LATER)
There's a KNOCK at the front door, a key turns in the lock, and Venkman
enters somewhat tentatively holding a bouquet of flowers and a small
suitcase of Dana's.
VENKMAN
(calls out)
I'm home!
He looks around the large open loft.
VENKMAN
(to himself)
I knew it. She cleaned.
He hears the SHOWER RUNNING and crosses to the bathroom. The door is
half-open and he can see Dana in the shower (tastefully blurred) through
the transparent vinyl curtain. He closes the bathroom door and looks at
the baby asleep on the bed, surrounded by pillows to prevent him rolling
off. Then he turns and bumps into Dana who's just coming out of the
bathroom wrapped in a towel. She jumps back into the bathroom.
She comes out again, this time wearing a robe.
VENKMAN
Are you all squeaky clean now?
DANA
(humoring him)
Yes, I'm very clean. Did they find anything
at my apartment?
She squeezes past him into the bedroom and closes the door.
VENKMAN
(through the door)
Nothing. They stayed there all night, went
through your personal stuff, made a bunch of
long-distance phone calls and cleaned out
your refrigerator. And didn't find anything.
Dana opens the bedroom door.
DANA
They didn't find anything? In the bathtub
... the pink ooze ... nothing? So, what do
I do now?
VENKMAN
Now you get dressed and we go out. I got a
babysitter and everything. Trust me, you
need it.
DANA
I'm not here to date. I can't leave Oscar
in a strange place with someone I don't know.
VENKMAN
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff. She's
one of my most valuable employees.
DANA
Does she know anything about babies?
VENKMAN
Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?
(handing her the flowers)
Do I have a vase? I brought some of your
clothes. Wear something intriguing. I
brought along some interesting possibilities.
DANA
Okay, but it's not a date. It's a dinner.
She smiles and closes the door again. He opens the closet and starts
looking for his good suit.
VENKMAN
Did you happen to see some shirts on the
floor in here?
DANA (O.S.)
I put them in your hamper. I thought they
were dirty.
VENKMAN
(shaking his head)
I have a hamper? Next time ask me first,
okay. I have more than two grades of
laundry. There're lots of subtle levels
between clean and dirty.
He pulls some clothes out of the hamper and inspects them.
VENKMAN
These aren't so bad yet. You just hang them
up for a while and they're fine.
CUT TO:
INT. FIREHOUSE - RECEPTION AREA - EARLY EVENING
Janine covers her computer terminal and starts turning out the lights.
Then she notices that the lights are still on upstairs. She starts
primping and freshening up her makeup.
INT. FIREHOUSE - LAB AREA - SAME TIME
Louis is strapping on a proton pack, preparing to deal with Slimer once
and for all. He's wearing a bicyclist's rearview mirror on a headband.
LOUIS
(to himself)
Okay, Stinky, this is it. Showdown time.
You and me, pal. You think you're smarter
than I am? We'll see about that.
(loud)
Oh, hello, Pizza Man! Oh, two larges! I
only ordered one. Oh, pepperoni and
pineapple. My absolute favorite. I guess
I'll have to eat these both by myself.
THE CEILING
Slimer pokes his head through the ceiling and scans the room hanging
upside down.
LOUIS
He spots Slimer through the rearview mirror.
LOUIS
(quietly)
Okay, let's boogie!
He whirls around and fires a proton stream at Slimer, slicing a burning a
gash across the ceiling.
THE STAIRS
Janine comes up and ducks as a bolt of energy streaks across the room and
strikes the wall behind her. Slimer disappears.
LOUIS
(embarrassed and apologetic)
Oh migod! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do
that. It was an accident.
JANINE
What are you doing up here?
LOUIS
I was trying to get that smelly green thing.
The guys asked me to help out. I'm like the
fifth Ghostbuster.
JANINE
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if
you're already an accountant?
LOUIS
Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls
in sick or gets hurt.
Louis quickly slips off the proton pack and sets it down.
JANINE
Have you made any plans yet? You know
tomorrow is New Year's Eve.
LOUIS
No, I celebrate at the beginning of my
corporate tax year which is March first.
That way I beat the crowds.
JANINE
That's very practical. I hate going out on
New Year's Eve, too.
There is an awkward silence between them and Janine starts to leave.
JANINE
Well, good night, Louis.
LOUIS
(on an impulse)
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting
something to eat on the way home?
JANINE
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd
babysit.
(seductively)
Do you want to babysit with me?
LOUIS
Oh, sure, that sounds great.
They exit.
CUT TO:
INT. VENKMAN'S LOFT - NIGHT (LATER)
There is a KNOCK at the door and Venkman goes to answer it. He's dressed
for the evening and looking very dapper.
INT. VENKMAN'S LOFT - ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Venkman opens the door and finds Stantz, Spengler and Winston standing
there wearing over-the-hip rubberized waders, firemen's slickers, and
miners' helmets, carrying tons of sensing devices, meters, collection
jars and photographic equipment. They look like they're rigged out for a
major spelunking expedition.
VENKMAN
(ushering them in)
Don't tell me, let me guess. All-you-can-eat
barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
STANTZ
We're going down into the sewer system to
see if we can trace the source of the
psycho-reactive slime flow. We thought you
might want to come along.
VENKMAN
Darn it! I wish I'd known you were going.
I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.
SPENGLER
You know, animals and lower life forms often
anticipate major disasters. Given the new
magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous
breeding surge in the cockroach population.
VENKMAN
Roach breeding? Sounds better and better.
(calls out)
Dana? The boys are going down under the
sewers tonight to look for slime. Egon
thinks there might even be some kind of big
roach-breeding surge. Should we forget about
dinner and go with them instead?
Dana steps into the living room looking very beautiful.
STANTZ
Wow.
Dana looks curiously at their outfits.
DANA
Hi.
They nod and wave back.
VENKMAN
(to Ray and Egon)
I think we're going to have to pass on the
sewer trip, boys. Let me know what you find
out.
STANTZ
(on his exit)
Okay, but you're missing all the fun.
INT. VAN HORNE STATION - NIGHT (LATER)
Stantz, Spengler and Winston come down the stairs into the station,
guided by a very old map of the underground city.
STANTZ
This is it. Van Horne Station. Right where
the old transit map said it would be.
They cross to the edge of the platform and look into the river of slime.
STANTZ
Let's get a sounding on the depth of that
flow.
Stantz has a long, coiled, graduated cord with a plumb bob on the end of
it attached to his utility belt.
STANTZ
Stand back.
He takes the cord in his hand, swings the plumb bob over his head and
casts it out into the middle of the flow. The plumb bob sinks and
Spengler reads the depth.
SPENGLER
Six feet -- seven -- eight --
STANTZ
That's it. It's on the bottom.
SPENGLER
Nine feet -- ten --
WINSTON
Is the line sinking?
SPENGLER
No, the slime is rising.
Stantz looks down and notices the slime rising over the edge of the
platform and around his boots.
STANTZ
(alarmed)
Let's get out of here, boys.
He starts to pull out the plumb line but it seems to be stuck.
Spengler tries to help, but whatever is pulling on the cord is stronger
than all three of them. As their unseen adversary pulls them closer and
closer to the edge, Stantz works desperately to unhook the cord from his
belt but finally just unhooks the whole belt. Spengler lets go in time
but Winston doesn't. He is jerked off his feet and into the slime flow.
Stantz and Spengler look at each other, summon their courage and jump in
after him.
CUT TO:
INT. ARMAND RESTAURANT - NIGHT (LATER)
Dana and Venkman are sitting at a table in an elegant restaurant nibbling
caviar and toasting with very expensive champagne.
VENKMAN
(very intimate)
Here's to -- us.
She sighs and drinks.
VENKMAN
So -- are you making any New Year's
resolutions?
DANA
I want to stop getting involved with men who
aren't good for me.
VENKMAN
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow,
or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
DANA
For one night in your life, do you think
it's possible for us to be completely real?
VENKMAN
All right, you want to be real? So tell me
why did you dump me?
DANA
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you. I just had
to protect myself. You really weren't very
good for me, you know.
VENKMAN
I'm not even good for me.
DANA
Why do you say things like that? You're so
much better than you know.
VENKMAN
Thank you. If I had that kind of support
on a daily basis, I could definitely shape
up by the turn of the century.
DANA
(already feeling the
effects of the champagne)
So why don't you give me a jingle in the
year 2000?
VENKMAN
Let me jingle you right now.
He leans over to kiss her.
DANA
Maybe I should call Janine.
VENKMAN
Don't worry. Janine has a very special way
with children.
They kiss.
CUT TO:
INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
Janine is on the sofa doing her nails while Louis paces with the baby.
JANINE
(looking around)
I can't believe a person could actually live
like this.
LOUIS
(to the baby)
So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in
a small mining operation and then one day a
beautiful princess came to live with them.
JANINE
It's really not a bad place. It just needs
a woman's touch.
LOUIS
(continuing)
So they bartered room and board in exchange
for housekeeping services, which was a good
deal for all of them because then they didn't
have to withhold tax and social security,
which I'm not saying is right but it's just
a story, so I guess it's all right. I can
finish this later if you're tired.
Louis goes into the bedroom and puts the baby down.
JANINE
You're really good with children, Louis. I
can tell.
(as he returns)
Why don't you come here and sit with me?
LOUIS
Okay.
He sits stiffly beside her on the sofa.
JANINE
(getting close)
Motherhood is a very natural instinct for
me. I'd like to have a baby myself.
Wouldn't you?
LOUIS
(gulps)
Tonight?
EXT. STREET - MANHOLE COVER - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
A manhole cover is dislodged and pushed up from below. It slides away,
and Winston crawls out of the manhole followed by Stantz and Spengler.
They are exhausted and covered with slime.
WINSTON
(uncharacteristically
angry)
Nice going, Ray! What were you trying to
do -- drown me?
STANTZ
(unusually mean)
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were
too stupid to drop that line.
WINSTON
(shoves him)
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll
punch your lights out.
STANTZ
Oh yeah? Anytime, anytime. Just go ahead
and try it.
Spengler steps between them with unprecedented aggression.
SPENGLER
If you two are looking for a fight, you got
one.
(putting up his fists)
Who wants it first? Come on, Ray. Try me,
sucker.
STANTZ
(squaring off)
Butt out, you pencil-necked geek. I've had
it with you.
They grab each other and start to tussle. Suddenly Spengler comes to his
senses and pulls them apart.
SPENGLER
(forcefully)
Strip! Right now! Get out of those clothes!
He starts yanking off his slicker and waders. Bewildered, Stantz and
Winston start doing the same. Spengler helps pull off their clothes and
throws them into the open manhole. Now wearing only long underwear, they
seem to return to normal.
WINSTON
What are we doing? Ray, I was ready to kill
you.
STANTZ
Don't you see? It's the slime. That stuff
is like pure, concentrated evil.
Stantz looks around and sees that they are standing right in front of the
museum.
SPENGLER
And it's all flowing right to this spot.
CUT TO:
INT. ARMAND RESTAURANT ENTRANCE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
The MAITRE D' looks up in surprise as Stantz, Spengler and Winston enter
the restaurant wearing only long underwear.
MAITRE D'
(intercepting them)
Can I help you?
Stantz looks around and spots Venkman.
STANTZ
That's all right, I see him.
They blow right by the Maitre d' who jumps back in horror as they pass.
VENKMAN
He's just about to pour more champagne when he sees Ray, Egon and Winston
coming toward him through the restaurant.
STANTZ
(very excited)
You should've been there, Venkman.
Absolutely incredible!
VENKMAN
Yeah, sorry I missed it.
(noting their attire)
I guess you guys didn't know about the dress
code here. It's really kind of a coat and
tie place.
STANTZ
It's all over the city, Pete -- well, under
it actually.
WINSTON
Rivers of the stuff!
SPENGLER
And it's all flowing toward the museum.
He gestures excitedly and a big gob of slime flies across the room and
lands on a well-dressed diner.
STANTZ
(calls out)
Sorry!
DANA
Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
Venkman notes the look of alarm on Dana's face and pulls his colleagues
aside.
VENKMAN
(confidentially)
Boys, listen. You're scaring the straights.
Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
SPENGLER
(to Venkman)
This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman.
It's hot and it's ready to pop.
MAITRE D'
He hurries through the restaurant with two city COPS right behind him and
makes straight for Venkman's table.
MAITRE D'
Arrest these men.
COP
(recognizing them)
Hey! It's the Ghostbusters. You're out of
uniform, gentlemen
Stantz suddenly realizes how ridiculous they look.
STANTZ
(self-conscious)
Uh -- well -- we had a little accident, but
forget that. We have to see the mayor as
soon as possible.
COP
Look, Doc, why don't you just go home.
You'll get a good night's sleep and then you
can give the mayor a call in the morning.
Come on.
He takes Stantz by the arm but Stantz resists.
STANTZ
We're not going anywhere with you. I told
you we have to see the mayor now.
COP
(grabbing Stantz)
I'm warning you. You can come along
peaceably or --
VENKMAN
(grabs the Cop)
Hey, don't be an idiot. This is serious.
COP
(angry)
Look, pal, keep this up and you're going
with them.
VENKMAN
Oh, yeah?
COP
(has had enough)
Yeah, let's go. You're all under arrest.
The Cop catches Venkman in an armlock and starts walking him out of the
restaurant.
VENKMAN
(to Dana)
Finish your dessert -- it's already paid
for. I'll call you.
They all exit, causing a major commotion among the other diners.
EXT. ARMAND'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
The police car is parked right behind Ecto-2. Spengler stops at the
police car and confronts the cops.
SPENGLER
Look, we're not drunk and we're not crazy.
This is a matter of vital importance.
Venkman steps in and looks at the policemen's nametags.
COP
What are you doing?
VENKMAN
I just want to get your names right for when
the mayor asks us why we didn't let him know
about this sooner.
The Cops look at each other, uncertain about what to do.
COP
(relenting)
Okay, Doc. You want to see the mayor, you
got it. Follow us.
They head for their respective vehicles.
CUT TO:
INT. VENKMAN'S LOFT - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
Louis and Janine are on the sofa making out when Dana enters. They jump
up and start smoothing their clothes.
LOUIS
(embarrassed)
Oh, hello, Dana. we were just -- we were --
DANA
I know what you were doing, Louis. It's
all right.
JANINE
How was your date?
DANA
Typical. Peter was arrested. Has he called?
LOUIS
No, nobody called.
Dana frowns.
DANA
Is everything all right with Oscar?
JANINE
Oh, he's fine. He's such a good baby. He
was a little fussy at first, but we gave
him a Freach bread pizza and he went right
to sleep.
DANA
(relieved)
Oh, good. I'll just check on him.
She crosses to the bedroom.
INT. VENKMAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
Dana looks at Oscar sleeping peacefully on the bed. She starts to change
clothes.
INT. VENKMAN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
Louis and Janine aren't sure what to do.
LOUIS
Should we go?
JANINE
I don't think we should leave her alone.
LOUIS
You're right. We should stay.
He grabs Janine and they start making out again.
CUT TO:
INT. MUSEUM RESTORATION STUDIO - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
Janosz stands before the painting of Vigo. Vigo comes to life and
repeats the litany of his power.
VIGO
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --
JANOSZ
(heard all this before)
Yes, the scourge --
VIGO
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
JANOSZ
-- the sorrow --
VIGO
I command you.
JANOSZ
(checking his watch)
I await the word of Vigo.
VIGO
The season of evil begins with the birth of
the new year. Bring me the child that I
might live again.
JANOSZ
(abjectly humble)
Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and
strong. I was wondering -- well, would it
be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I
have the woman?
VIGO
So be it. On this the day of darkness, she
will be ours, wife to you and mother to me.
CUT TO:
EXT. CARL SCHURZ PARK - NIGHT (LATER)
Preceded by a police car, Ecto-2 enters the small park on the East River
at 88th Street and disappears into an underground entrance. The CAMERA
PANS UP to reveal Gracie Mansion, the residence of the Mayor of New York
City.
INT. GRACIE MANSION - MOMENTS LATER
The Ghostbusters, now wearing police raincoats over their longjohns are
ushered through the house by a butler to a set of double oak doors. The
butler knocks lightly, then opens the door to reveal the MAYOR sitting in
front of the fireplace in his well-appointed private study, flanked by
Jack Hardemeyer, both in tuxedoes. The Ghostbusters enter.
INT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS ACTION
The Mayor is impatient and a little angry at having been pulled out of
his formal reception. He frowns at their bizarre attire.
MAYOR
All right -- the Ghostbusters. I'll tell
you right now; I've got two hundred of the
heaviest campaign contributors in the city
out there eating bad roast chicken waiting
for me to give the speech of my life.
You've got two minutes. Make it good.
STANTZ
You get enough negative energy flowing in a
dense environment like Manhattan, it starts
to build up, and if we don't do something
fast this whole place will blow like a frog
on a hotplate.
WINSTON
Tell him about the toaster.
VENKMAN
I don't think he's ready for the toaster.
MAYOR
(shaking his head)
Being miserable and treating other people
like dirt is every New Yorker's God-given
right. What am I supposed to do -- go on
television and tell eight million people
they have to be nice to each other? I'm
sorry, none of this makes any sense to me,
and if anything does happen we've got plenty
of paid professionals to deal with it. Your
two minutes are up. Good night, gentlemen.
The mayor exits, leaving the Ghostbusters to Hardemeyer.
HARDEMEYER
(smirking)
That's quite a story.
VENKMAN
Yeah, I think the Times might be interested,
don't you? The Post might have a lot of fun
with it, too.
Hardemeyer's eyes go cold and calculating.
HARDEMEYER
Before you go running to the newspapers with
this, would you consider telling this slime
thing to some people downtown?
VENKMAN
Now you're talking.
CUT TO:
INT. PARKVIEW HOSPITAL - PSYCHIATRIC WARD - NIGHT (LATER)
An attendant opens a locked door with a wire mesh window and the
Ghostbusters, in straitjackets, are led into the psych ward as Hardemeyer
confers with the chief PSYCHIATRIST.
WINSTON
(protesting)
I'm telling you, we're not crazy. He is!
HARDEMEYER
He laughs off the remark.
HARDEMEYER
(to the Psychiatrist)
The mayor wants them kept under strict
observation for a few days. We think
they're seriously disturbed and potentially
dangerous.
PSYCHIATRIST
We'll do whatever's necessary.
Hardemeyer shakes his hand and exits as the door slams shut on the
Ghostbusters.
INT. VENKMAN'S LOFT - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
Louis and Janine are watching an old rerun on TV, eating popcorn, while
Dana is stretched out on the other sofa.
DANA
(wishing they'd leave)
You know you really don't have to stay.
Peter should be back soon.
LOUIS
Oh no, we don't mind.
She hears a little CRY from the nursery and sits up.
DANA
Excuse me. I think Oscar is up.
She crosses to the bedroom.
INT. VENKMAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
Dana enters and immediately notices that the crib is empty and the window
is open.
DANA
(screams)
Louis!
Frantic now, Dana rushes to the window and looks out, as Louis and Janine
come running in.
EXT. WINDOW LEDGE - DANA'S POV - NIGHT (ECLIPSE)
The baby is standing out on the ledge at the corner of the building,
fifty feet above the street, staring off into the distance as if he's
waiting for something.
EXT. WINDOW LEDGE - NIGHT (ECLIPSE) (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
Dana climbs out onto the ledge and starts inching slowly toward the baby.
Then she stops as a miraculous apparition materializes.
LOUIS AND JANINE
They lean out the window, gaping at the apparition.
EXT. VENKMAN'S LEDGE - APPARITION
A sweet, kindly-looking English nanny appears, pushing a pram, strolling
on thin air parallel to the ledge high above the ground. Her face looks
remarkably like Janosz Poha's. The nanny extends her hand to the BABY
who GURGLES sweetly as he reaches out to take it.
DANA
She watches in helpless horror.
DANA
(screams)
No!!
GHOST NANNY
She picks up the baby and lays it gently in the pram, then turns and
smiles at Dana. The smile turns to a hideous grin, then the nanny
shrieks at Dana and takes off like a shot with the baby.
DANA
She watches the creature fly off with Oscar, then climbs back through
the window assisted by Louis and Janine.
DANA
(resolutely)
Louis, you have to find Peter and tell him
what happened.
LOUIS
(confused and worried)
Where're you going?
DANA
To get my baby back.
CUT TO:
EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT (A LITTLE LATER)
A taxi pulls up, Dana jumps out and rushes into the museum. The moment
the door closes behind her, there is a loud THUNDERCLAP, the ground
trembles and a massive amount of slime erupts from around the base of
the museum and starts covering the walls, sealing her inside the
building.
CUT TO:
INT. PARKVIEW PSYCHIATRIC - PADDED ROOM - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
Venkman, Stantz, Spengler and Winston are in a padded cell. They are
handcuffed and the cuffs are chained to thick leather belts around their
waists. Venkman stands there banging his head into the padded wall
while the others try to explain the situation to a skeptical
Psychiatrist.
STANTZ
We think the spirit of Vigo the Carpathian
is alive in a painting at the Manhattan
Museum.
PSYCHIATRIST
I see. And are there any other paintings in
the museum with bad spirits in them?
SPENGLER
(impatient)
You're wasting valuable time! We have reason
to believe that Vigo is drawing strength from
a psychomagnetheric slime flow that's been
collecting under the city.
PSYCHIATRIST
Yes, tell me about the slime.
WINSTON
It's potent stuff. We made a toaster dance
with it, then a bathtub tried to eat his
friend's baby.
The psychiatrist looks at Venkman.
VENKMAN
Don't look at me. I think they're nuts.
CUT TO:
INT. MUSEUM RESTORATION STUDIO - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
Moonlight streams through the skylight above, bathing the studio in
eerie white light. Oscar is lying safely on a table in front of the
painting of Vigo. Dana enters cautiously and sees the baby. Seeing no
one else about, she quickly sneaks down to the table and picks up the
baby, hugging hin tight, greatly relieved to find him unharmed and
intact.
JANOSZ (O.S.)
I knew you would come.
Startled, Dana turns at the sound of his voice as Janosz steps out from
behind the Vigo painting.
DANA
(defiantly)
What do you want with my baby?
JANOSZ
No harm will come to the child. You might
even say it's a privilege. He will be the
vessel for the spirit of Vigo. And you --
well, you will be the mother of the ruler
of the world. Doesn't that sound nice?
DANA
If this is what the world will be like, I
don't want to live in it.
JANOSZ
(confidentially, indicating
Vigo)
I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
DANA
Everybody has a choice.
JANOSZ
Not in this case, my dear. Take a look.
That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there.
He's Vigo!
DANA
I don't care who he is. He's not taking my
baby.
Dana walks quickly to the door but suddenly Oscar flies out of her arms,
floats across the room and lands lightly back in the cradle.
DANA
She turns and looks at Vigo, for the first time feeling his power.
JANOSZ
You will see. It's all for the best.

EXT. PARKVIEW HOSPITAL - DAY (NEXT MORNING)
It's the last day of the year and the sun is shining brightly.
CUT TO:
INT. PARKVIEW PSYCHIATRIC WARD - DAY (SAME TIME)
The Ghostbusters are sitting in the dayroom, a dingy lounge for patients
in the locked ward. There is a television set, a Ping-Pong table and a
few tables and chairs. Stantz is looking at the sky through the heavy
wire mesh covering the windows.
STANTZ
This is it. boys. It's starting. Shit-storm
2000.
Venkman is doing occupational therapy, weaving on a little hand-loom.
VENKMAN
It better not start yet. I'm trying to
finish my potholder before lunch.
WINSTON
You think all those predictions about the
world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
A PATIENT at the next table joins the discussion.
PATIENT
(with certainty)
1997. My dog told me.
VENKMAN
What kind of dog?
PATIENT
Labrador.
VENKMAN
(shakes his head)
Habitual liars. They can't help it. It's
in the breed.
CUT TO:
INT. PARKVIEW HOSPITAL - EXAMINING ROOM - DAY (SAME TIME)
Louis is pleading with his cousin, SHERMAN TULLY, a doctor on the staff
at Parkview. He looks and sounds just like Louis.
LOUIS
Come on, Sherm. You're my cousin. Do this
for me. I'm begging you.
SHERMAN
I can't do it, Louis. It isn't ethical. I
could lose my license.
LOUIS
Why can't you just have them released?
You're a doctor.
SHERMAN
I'm a dermatologist. I can't write orders
on the psych ward.
LOUIS
Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.
SHERMAN
Like what?
LOUIS
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
SHERMAN
You were the one who got me in.
LOUIS
I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she
put out, didn't she?
SHERMAN
Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion
for a year. Forget it, Louis. I could get
in a lot of trouble.
LOUIS
I'm telling you, we're all going to be in
big trouble if we don't do something fast.
That ghost guy came and took my friend's
baby and we got to get it back. It's just
a scared little baby, Sherm.
SHERMAN
Then you should go to the police. I don't
believe in any of that stuff.
Sherman looks out the window.
EXT. SKY - SHERMAN'S POV
The sky begins to go dark as the sun is magically eclipsed.
INT. EXAMINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY
The room goes dark. Louis switches on a lamp which casts an eerie light
on his face.
LOUIS
(spooky)
Do you believe it now, Sherm?
CUT TO:
EXT. HUDSON RIVER PIER - NIGHT (ECLIPSE)
A drainpipe starts dripping slime into the river near the Cunard Line
docks.
CUT TO:
EXT. PUBLIC FOUNTAIN (59TH AND FIFTH) - NIGHT (ECLIPSE)
With the Plaza Hotel in the background, the fountain starts to spout
psycho-reactive slime.
HOTEL ENTRANCE
A well-heeled MAN and WOMAN step out of a limousine and walk up the steps
toward the revolving door. She looks up at the sky and frowns.
WOMAN
(shrewish)
I told you we should have stayed in Palm
Beach. The weather here gets stranger every
year.
MAN
Yes, dear.
She doesn't notice it, but a small amount of slime falls on the back of
her luxurious, full-length, white mink coat. The doorman nods
courteously and extends a hand to help her up the stairs.
WOMAN
She yelps in pain.
WOMAN
(to the doorman)
Something just bit me!
The doorman looks curiously at her, then recoils in shock as her coat
comes alive. MINK HEADS pop out of the thick fur, SNARLING, BARKING and
YAPPING, their sharp, little teeth biting the air. Reacting quickly, the
doorman yanks the coat off the woman's back, throws it to the ground and
starts stomping on it as the Woman and her husband look on in horror.
The coat scuttles down the steps and runs off down the street.
CUT TO:
INT. MIDTOWN CENTRAL POLICE PRECINCT - NIGHT (ECLIPSE)
The squad room is busy as DETECTIVES try to answer the flood of calls
regarding the wave of supernatural events sweeping the city.
DETECTIVE ONE
(on the phone)
Look, lady, of course there are dead people
there. It's a cemetery ...
(his face falls)
They were asking you for directions?
DETECTIVE TWO
(on another phone)
Was this a big dinosaur or a little dinosaur?
... Oh, just the skeleton, huh? Well, where
is it now?
DETECTIVE THREE
(on the phone)
Wait a second -- the park bench was chasing
you? You mean, someone was chasing you in
the park ... No, the bench itself was chasing
you. I see --
A weary SERGEANT answers a RINGING PHONE.
SERGEANT
Manhattan Central, Flaherty speaking ...
Yeah ... yeah? ... What? Who is this? ...
Wait a second.
He puts the caller on ""Hold"" and turns the LIEUTENANT.
SERGEANT
Lieutenant, I think you better talk to this
guy.
LIEUTENANT
(on another call)
What is it? I'm talkin' here!
SERGEANT
It's some dock supervisor down at Pier 34
on the Hudson. The guy's going nuts.
LIEUTENANT
What's the problem?
SERGEANT
(takes a deep breath)
He says the Titanic just arrived.
INT. PORT AUTHORITY OFFICE - NIGHT (ECLIPSE)
The dock supervisor stands there with the phone in his hand, an assistant
beside him, both staring out the window at the ocean liner tied up at the
pier.
EXT. PIER 34 - THEIR POV - NIGHT (ECLIPSE)
The name ""R.M.S. Titanic"" is clearly visible on the side of the huge
ship. The gangplank is down and dozens of drowned passengers, sopping
wet and festooned with seaweed, are disembarking while drowned porters
off-load their waterlogged baggage.
CUT TO:
EXT. PARKVIEW HOSPITAL - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)(ECLIPSE)
Ecto-2 is parked outside as Louis and Sherman come out of the hospital
with the Ghostbusters, now wearing their standard uniforms.
STANTZ
Good work, Louis. How did you get us out?
LOUIS
Oh, I pulled a few strings. I wouldn't want
to say any more than that.
Louis winks conspiratorially at Sherman.
LOUIS
This is my cousin Sherman. Sherm, say hello
to the Ghostbusters.
(sotto voce to Stantz)
I promised him a ride in the car if he got
you out.
SHERMAN
(to the Ghostbusters)
Hi, it's really great to meet you guys. I
know this sounds weird but once I had a
dream that my grandfather was standing at
the foot of my bed, but I knew it was
impossible because he died and he started
to tell me that --
While he's talking, the Ghostbusters jump in the Ectomobile and drive
off, leaving him and Louis standing at the curb.
LOUIS
Hey! Wait! Okay, I'll meet you there.
SHERMAN
I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
LOUIS
I let them handle all the little stuff. I
just come in on the big ones.

LOUIS
Actually, they still think you're crazy, but
I convinced them you're not dangerous.
VENKMAN
(determined)
Yeah, well guess again.
EXT. BELLEVUE HOSPITAL - NIGHT (ECLIPSE)(MOMENTS LATER)
Ecto-2 is parked outside and the Ghostbusters are hastily donning their
standard uniforms.
LOUIS
I brought everything you asked for and I
gassed up the car with Super Unleaded. It
cost twenty cents more than Regular Unleaded
but you get much better performance and in
an old car like this that'll end up saving
you money in the long run. I put it on my
credit card, so you can either reimburse me
or I can take it out of petty cash --
While he's talking, the Ghostbusters jump in the Ecto-2 and drive
off without him.
LOUIS
Hey! Wait! Okay, I'll meet you there.
CUT TO:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT (ECLIPSE)(LATER)
ECTO-2 pulls to the curb across the street from the museum. Hundreds of
spectators are already there gawking at the building as the Ghostbusters
jump out and gape at the sight that greets them.
EXT. MUSEUM THEIR POV - BUILDING
The building is now totally covered in a shell of psycho-reactive slime.
CITY WORKMEN and FIREMEN are trying to cut their way in with blowtorches,
jackhammers, power tools and the ""jaws of life,"" but they can't even make
a dent.
GHOSTBUSTERS
They size up the situation as they don their proton packs.
STANTZ
It looks like a giant Jello mold.
VENKMAN
I hate Jello.
They stride manfully across the street and approach the main entrance to
the museum.
STANTZ
(to the Fire Captain)
Okay, give it a rest, Captain. We'll take
it from here.
FIRE CAPTAIN
(skeptical)
Be my guest. We been cutting here for three
hours. What the hell's going on? You know
the Titanic arrived this morning?
VENKMAN
Well, better late than never.
The workmen and firemen put down their tools and fall back as the
Ghostbusters draw their particle throwers.
SPENGLER
(monitoring valences)
Full neutronas, maser assist.
They adjust their settings and prepare to fire.
STANTZ
Throw 'em!
They trigger their throwers and spray the front doors of the building
with bolts of proton energy, but it has no effect on the hardened slime.
VENKMAN
(to the firemen)
Okay, who knows ""Cumbaya?""
A few of the firemen and workmen tentatively raise their hands. Venkman
grabs them and lines them up at the entrance of the museum.
VENKMAN
All right. Nice and sweet --
(starts singing)
Cumbaya, milord, cumbaya --
Stantz, Spengler, Winston and the firemen sing along, reluctantly holding
hands and swaying to the music.
ALL
(singing)
Cumbaya, milord, cumbaya, Cumbaya, milord,
cumbaya, Oh, Lord, cumbaya.
Stantz inspects the wall of slime with his infra-goggles and finds that
they have only managed to open a hole the size of a dime.
STANTZ
Forget it. The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't
get through this stuff.
VENKMAN
Good effort. Now what? Should we say
supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
SPENGLER
It won't work. There's no way we could
generate enough positive energy to crack
that shell.
STANTZ
I can't believe things have gotten so bad
in this city that there's no way back.
Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy.
And there are too many people who'd just as
soon step on your face as look at you. But
there've got to be a few sparks of sweet
humanity left in this burned-out burg. We
just have to mobilize it.
SPENGLER
We need something that everyone can get
behind, a symbol --
His eyes fall on ECTO-2's New York State license plate which features a
line drawing of the Statue of Liberty.
STANTZ
(he sees it, too)
Something that appeals to the best in each
and every one of us --
SPENGLER
Something good --
VENKMAN
And pure --
WINSTON
And decent.
EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
There is a commotion among the crowd as the Mayor's limousine arrives
with a police escort. Jack Hardemeyer steps out followed by the Mayor
himself and they cross to the museum entrance.
Hardemeyer, his ASSISTANT and several police BODYGUARDS confront the
Ghostbusters.
HARDEMEYER
Look, I've had it with you. Get your stuff
together, get back in that clown car and get
out of here. This is a city matter and
everything's under control.
VENKMAN
Oh, you think so? Well, I've got news for
you. You've got Dracula's brother-in-law
in there and he's got my girlfriend and her
kid. Around about midnight tonight, when
you're partying uptown, this guy's going to
come to life and start doing amateur head
transplants. And that's just round one.
MAYOR
Are you telling me there're people trapped
in there?
HARDEMEYER
(to his assistant)
This is dynamite. Call A.P., U.P.I., and
C.N.N. and get them down here right away.
When the police bring this kid out I want
them to hand it right to the mayor and I
want it all on camera.
STANTZ
Mr. Mayor, if we don't do something by
midnight, you're going to go down in history
as the man who let New York get sucked down
into the tenth level of hell.
The Mayor stops to consider the situation.
MAYOR
(to the Fire Captain)
Can you get into that museum?
FIRE CAPTAIN
If I had a nuclear warhead, maybe.
The Mayor turns to Venkman.
MAYOR
You know why all these things are happening?
VENKMAN
We tried to tell you last night, but Mr.
Hard-On over here packed us off to the loony
bin.
Hardemeyer flips out.
HARDEMEYER
This is preposterous! You can't seriously
believe all this mumbo-jumbo! It's the
Twentieth Century, for crying out loud!
(viciously, to Venkman)
Look, mister, I don't know what this stuff
is or how you got it all over the museum,
but you better get it off and I mean right
now!
He pounds the wall of slime with his fist, and they all watch in
amazement as his fist goes through the wall and he is sucked bodily
through the slime curtain. Only his shoes can be seen, embedded in the
slime.
MAYOR
(to Venkman)
Okay, just tell me what you need.
CUT TO:
EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND (NEW YORK HARBOR) - NIGHT
With the city skyline in the b.g., the Ghostbusters prepare their
equipment. Each of them dons a makeshift backpack consisting of tanks,
hoses, nozzles and an abundance of gauges, valves and regulators.
Venkman looks up at the Statue of Liberty looming above them.
VENKMAN
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
WINSTON
Wonder what?
VENKMAN
If she's naked under that toga. She's
French, you know.
SPENGLER
There's nothing under that toga but 300 tons
of iron and steel.
Stantz is looking worried.
STANTZ
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
VENKMAN
Only one way to find out.
(to Stantz)
Ready, Teddy?
They enter the statue.
CUT TO:
INT. STATUE OF LIBERTY - MOMENTS LATER
The Ghostbusters are working from the iron staircase that spirals
straight up 100 feet inside the hollow super-structure of the statue.
Spengler and Winston are busy assembling hundreds of wires connected to
various relays on the interior surface of the statue. Venkman and Stantz
are mounting large auditorium loudspeakers near the top of the staircase.
They finish the installation, then Stantz dons one of the new backpacks
and gives the order.
STANTZ
Okay, boys. Let's frost it.
They begin hosing the inside of the statue with the psycho-reactive
slime.
CUT TO:
INT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
Janine watches as Louis, wearing a Ghostbuster uniform, slings a heavy
proton pack onto his back.
JANINE
I'm not sure this is such a good idea? Do
they know you're doing this?
LOUIS
Oh, yeah, sure -- no. But there's really
not much to do here and they might need
some back-up at the museum.
JANINE
You're very brave, Louis. Good luck.
She kisses Louis and he gets extremely self-conscious.
LOUIS
Uh -- oh -- well, I better hurry.
He rushes out.
EXT STREET OUTSIDE FIREHOUSE - NIGHT (LITTLE LATER)
Louis stands on the street corner waiting for a bus. Finally, a bus
pulls up, Louis climbs aboard and finds Slimer behind the wheel.
CUT TO:
INT. STATUE OF LIBERTY - OBSERVATION DECK - MOMENTS LATER
Venkman, Stantz, Spengler and Winston are standing in the observation
windows in the crown of the statue. It looks like they're on the bridge
of an ocean liner, then the CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal the head of the
statue.
STANTZ
He plugs the main cable lead into a transformer.
STANTZ
It's all yours, Pete.
(checks his watch)
There's not much time left.
Venkman plugs the speaker cable into a Walkman and gives a downbeat.
VENKMAN
(giving the downbeat)
Okay, one, two, three, four --
He hits ""Play"" on the Walkman and ""HIGHER AND HIGHER"" BOOMS from the huge
SPEAKERS, amplified by the statue's vast hollow interior.
INT. OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
The head of the statue lurches suddenly, but the Ghostbusters cling to
the rail and manage to keep their feet.
STANTZ
She's moving!
WINSTON
I've lived in New York all my life and I
never visited the Statue of Liberty. Now I
finally get here and we're taking her out
for a walk.
SPENGLER
(reading the Giga-meter)
We've got full power.
Stantz picks up a Nintendo control paddle from a home video game and
starts pushing the buttons.
VENKMAN
(into a microphone)
Okay, Libby. Let's get it in gear.
They feel a strong vibration and the statue starts to move.
CUT TO:
EXT. SOUTH STREET SEAPORT - NIGHT
New Years Eve celebrants line the riverfront, pointing and gawking at an
incredible sight.
EXT. EAST RIVER - THEIR POV - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
The statue is moving up the river almost completely submerged, only her
head from the nose up is visible above the surface.
INT. OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
Winston looks out apprehensively.
WINSTON
How deep does it get? That water's cold and
I can't swim.
VENKMAN
It's okay. I have my Senior Lifesaving card.
SPENGLER
With a water temperature of forty degrees
we'd survive approximately fifteen minutes.
Stantz studies a maritime navigational chart.
STANTZ
I'll keep to the middle of the channel.
We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go
ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.
VENKMAN
Are you kidding? We'll hit all that bridge
traffic at 59th. I'm going to take 72nd
straight up to Fifth. Trust me, I used to
drive a cab.
CUT TO:
EXT. RIVERFRONT - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
Spectators cheer wildly, inspired by the sight of the Statue.
CUT TO:
INT. MUSEUM RESTORATION STUDIO - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
Janosz is sitting next to Dana, still wheedling her with promises and
self-serving logic.
JANOSZ
Time is running out, Dana. Soon it will be
midnight and the city will be mine -- and
Vigo's. Well, mainly Vigo's. But we have
a spectacular opportunity to make the best
of our relationship.
DANA
We don't have a relationship.
JANOSZ
I know. Marry me, Dana, and together we
will raise Vigo as our son. There are many
perks that come with being the mother of a
living god. I'm sure he will supply for us
a magnificent apartment. And perhaps a car
and free parking.
DANA
I hate and despise you and everything you
stand for with all my heart and soul. I
could never forgive what you've done to me
and my child.
JANOSZ
Many marriages begin with a certain amount
of distance, but after a while I believe we
could learn to love each other. Think about
it.
DANA
I'd rather not.
CUT TO:
EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
People are jammed together shoulder to shoulder filling Times Square,
watching the big Seiko clock count down the last ten minutes to midnight.
Suddenly, they look down Broadway and see a magnificent sight.
EXT. BROADWAY - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
The Statue of Liberty is walking up Broadway approaching 42nd Street,
with ""Higher and Higher"" BOOMING from the SPEAKERS inside. A great cheer
goes up, and the crowd goes wild with joy, dancing and singing along with
the MUSIC.
INT. STATUE OF LIBERTY OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
Spengler reads the Giga-meter.
SPENGLER
It's working. The positive GeV's are
climbing.
VENKMAN
(patting the Statue)
They love you, Lib. Keep it up.
CUT TO:
EXT. FIFTH AVENUE - NIGHT (LATER)
The avenue has been closed to traffic and barricades placed, blocking all
the side streets. A squadron of police motorcycles comes speeding around
the corner at 72nd Street and proceeds up Fifth Avenue in the direction
of the museum. Then MUSIC is heard BOOMING in the distance, the ground
shakes and the Statue of Liberty comes walking around the corner onto
Fifth Avenue followed by a wildly cheering throng.
CUT TO:
INT. OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
The Ghostbusters can see the museum ahead.
VENKMAN
So far so good.
SPENGLER
(worried)
I'm worried. The vibrations could shake her
to pieces. We should have padded her feet.
STANTZ
I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
VENKMAN
We're almost there, Lib.
(to Stantz)
Step on it.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
The Statue's huge foot comes down and squashes a car.
INT. OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
The Ghostbusters look down at the flattened car.
STANTZ
(shouts out the window)
My Fault!
VENKMAN
(shouts)
She's new in town.
CUT TO:
INT. MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - SAME TIME
Janosz is painting the last of the mystical symbols on the baby's chest.
CUT TO:

The people still in the square start counting off the last ten seconds to
midnight and the New Year.
CROWD
(chanting)
Ten .. nine ... eight ... seven ...
CUT TO:
INT. MUSEUM - PAINTING - NIGHT
A strange light spreads over the painting. As the light moves onto his
face, Vigo spreads his arms wide and his upper body starts to emerge from
the canvas.
VIGO
Soon my life begins. Then woe to the weak,
all power to me, the world is mine.
INT. MUSEUM - JANOSZ - NIGHT
The baby's body begins to glow as Vigo reaches out for it. Then suddenly
a dark shadow falls across the skylight. Janosz looks up.
INT. MUSEUM - JANOSZ'S POV - SKYLIGHT - NIGHT
The Statue of Liberty is looming over the skylight looking down on Janosz
with an expression of righteous anger on it's face.
EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
Kneeling beside the museum, the statue draws back it's mighty right arm
and smashes the skylight with its torch.
INT. RESTORATION STUDIO - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
Janosz retreats from the shower of broken glass as the Ghostbusters come
sliding down ropes into the studio and confront Janosz with their new
weapons. Quick as a flash, Dana seizes the moment, dashes across the
studio and snatches the baby from Vigo's outstretched arms.
VENKMAN
(to Janosz)
Happy New Year.
INT. MUSEUM - VIGO PAINTING - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
Vigo bellows in rage.
INT. MUSEUM - STUDIO - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
Janosz steps in front of the painting.
SPENGLER
Hi there. Feel free to try something stupid.
Janosz sneers, trusting the invincibility of Vigo.
JANOSZ
You pitiful, miserable creatures! You dare
to challenge the power of darkness? Don't
you realize what you are dealing with? He's
Vigo! You are like the buzzing of flies to
him.
VENKMAN
(sighs)
Oh, Johnny. Did you back the wrong horse.
With that, the Ghostbusters fire their slime-blowers and hose Janosz from
head to toe, blowing him into the corner. Then they turn to Vigo.
VIGO
He is now almost completely out of the painting, but still held from the
knees down. He spits and rages at the Ghostbusters, trying to unleash
his magic powers.
THE GHOSTBUSTERS
They stand fast, secure in the knowledge that Vigo's power has been
neutralized by the good will of the people.
STANTZ
Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad
little monkey.
VENKMAN
The whole city's together on this one. We
took a vote. Everybody's down on you, you
know.
WINSTON
(arming his slime-blower)
Say goodnight now.
Suddenly Vigo grabs Stantz by the neck and holds him up as a shield.
SPENGLER
Don't shoot! You'll hit Ray!
STANTZ
(strangling)
Do it! Just do it!
Winston fires and hoses both Vigo and Ray.
VIGO
He bellows and drops Ray, then falls back into the painting.
INT. MUSEUM - PAINTING - NIGHT
The paint turns liquid, melts off the canvas and runs onto the floor
revealing another painting underneath it.
INT. MUSEUM - GHOSTBUSTERS - NIGHT (AFTER BATTLE)
Venkman, Spengler and Winston rush over to Ray and kneel beside him. He
is completely covered with slime and motionless.
SPENGLER
(examining him)
He's breathing.
Winston wipes the slime off Ray's face and Ray opens his eyes.
WINSTON
Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
STANTZ
(smiles lovingly)
Groovy. I've never felt better in my life.
VENKMAN
Oh, no. We've got to live with this?
They pull him to his feet.
STANTZ
I love you guys. You're the best friends
I've ever had.
He hugs them each in turn, leaving them slimed as well. Venkman recoils
in disgust.
VENKMAN
Hey, I just had this suit cleaned.
(indicating Janosz)
Take care of the wiggler, will you.
Venkman crosses to Dana who is snuggling the baby. She hugs Venkman.
VENKMAN
What is this -- a love in?
(notes the symbols painted
on the baby's body)
Hey, sailor. I think the tattoos are a
little much, don't you?
He picks up the baby.
DANA
(to Venkman)
I think he likes you. I think I do too.
VENKMAN
Finally came to your senses, huh?
They hug and kiss.
SPENGLER, WINSTON AND STANTZ
They help Janosz to his feet. He's dazed but unhurt.
JANOSZ
(restored to normalcy)
What happened?
STANTZ
(calmly)
Sir, you had a violent, prolonged,
transformative psychic episode. But it's
over now. Want a coffee?
JANOSZ
(extremely nice)
That's very kind of you.
SPENGLER
(to Stantz)
He's fine, Ray. Physically intact,
psychomagnetherically neutral.
JANOSZ
Is that good?
WINSTON
It's where you want to be.
As they exit they stop to examine the painting that was concealed by
Vigo's self-portrait.
SPENGLER
Late Renaissance, I think. Caravaggio or
Brunelleschi.
WINSTON
(staring at it)
There's something very familiar about this
painting.
INT. MUSEUM - NEW PAINTING - NIGHT
It's a beautiful painting in the high-Renaissance style depicting four
archangels hovering protectively over a cherubic baby. One holds a harp,
one, an olive branch, the third, a book, and the last, a sword. Most
remarkably, their faces bear an uncanny resemblance to Venkman, Stantz,
Spengler and Winston.
CUT TO:
EXT. STREET - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
A city bus pulls up near the museum and Louis steps off. He waves his
thanks to Slimer who is behind the wheel.
LOUIS
(to Slimer)
Okay, so Monday night we'll get something
to eat and maybe go bowling? Can you bowl
with those little arms?
SLIMER GRUNTS and SLOBBERS a reply, flexing his scrawny biceps.
LOUIS
Okay, I have to go save Dana. I'll see you
later.
CUT TO:
EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT (LITTLE LATER)
The Ghostbusters are greeted by wild cheering and applause as they come
out the main entrance with Dana and the baby. Everybody starts singing
""Auld Lang Syne."" Louis picks his way through the celebrating crowd and
finds the Ghostbusters.
LOUIS
Am I too late?
STANTZ
No, you're right on time.
Stantz pops the cork on a bottle of champagne and hands it to him.
EXT. MUSEUM ENTRANCE - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
Hardemeyer staggers out of the museum covered in slime. He looks at the
celebrating crowd and his eyes fill with tears.
HARDEMEYER
(weepy)
Happy New Year, everybody!
He joins in on ""Auld Lang Syne.""
CUT TO:
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT (LATER)
The Statue of Liberty is sprawled inert on her back in the park behind
the museum, her toga up over her knees. The Mayor looks nearly suicidal.
The Ghostbusters stand beside him commiserating.
VENKMAN
She's all right. She's just sleeping it off.
MAYOR
(stricken)
We just had it restored.
VENKMAN
This probably isn't a good time to bring
this up, but the last time we did a job for
the city you stiffed us.
STANTZ
(handing the Mayor an
invoice)
This is a bill for tonight's job.
The Mayor looks at it and gasps at the amount.
MAYOR
What! This is way too much.
(hands the bill back to
Venkman)
We won't pay.
Venkman looks at the Statue.
VENKMAN
(to Stantz)
I think she looks pretty good here, don't
you?
STANTZ
Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.
Realizing he has no alternative, the Mayor sighs and takes the bill back.
MAYOR
All right, all right. If you can wait until
Monday I'll issue you a check.
SPENGLER
Sorry. No checks. Company policy.
CUT TO:
EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - DAY (WEEKS LATER)
The sun is shining brightly and Liberty is back on her pedestal where she
belongs. The Mayor and a host of officials are commemorating her return.
The Ghostbusters, Dana, Janine and Louis are there as honored guests.
VENKMAN
(looking up at the statue)
Pretty impressive, huh?
SPENGLER
(musing)
It's probably the first thing my
grandparents saw when they came to this
country.
VENKMAN
From where -- Neptune?
SPENGLER
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
VENKMAN
Ostrov? I've been there. Good party town.
STANTZ
(in a similarly reflective
mood)
My great-grandparents were Swiss. I still
have the pictures they took of the statue
from the boat when they arrived.
VENKMAN
Oh, right, you told me that. They came to
America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I
recall. How about you, Winston?
WINSTON
My people weren't taking any pictures from
those slave ships, man. And there wasn't
any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome
them, either. What are you, Dana?
VENKMAN
Miss Blue Blood? Her family's been here
since the year 12.
DANA
That's not true. It was 1620.
VENKMAN
Same difference.
STANTZ
What's your story, Pete?
VENKMAN
Me? I'm a little of everything. Some Irish,
some German, some French, Dutch -- the women
in my family slept around. And that's what
made this country great.
DANA
That's a terrible thing to say.
VENKMAN
So what? It's a free country.
(looking up at the Statue)
Thanks, Lib.
They all look up at the Statue.
EXT. STATUE OF LIBERTY - HEAD OF STATUE - DAY
Slimer flies out one of the observation windows, THEME MUSIC KICKS IN and
the CAMERA PULLS UP and AWAY FROM the island TO a HIGH SHOT of the
Statue, lower Manhattan and the shining sea beyond.
FADE OUT.

And suddenly ev'rywhere we go
The sun beams through in fun
The leaves form patterns like a heart
And whisper forever ""Never part.""
Be true, 'cause I love you
Shadows write words of love across our path;
Birds sing ""How lucky those whose love just grows together.""
Blades of grass stand on and on
And chatter together in a calm
That's green and so serene
A mem'ry of our walk of love
In a dream, a stream goes by
Reflecting a message from the sky above
And here and there we look around
To see other lovers who have found
Their way
Crickets tap out their symphony in code;
Rabbits run helter skelter finding shelter here
And flowers swaying in the breeze
Look up to the branches of the trees
And sing as birds take wing
All this is true 'cause I love you"

If you think of counting me
Count me out
When you count the ones that want you
Count me, too
And if I'm not first on your list
Count me blue
Just be sure you count on me
And when the countings through
Count me madly in love with you
If you need someone to count on
When you're down
And all your other friends you've lost
Count me found
Just be sure you count on me
When you're down and out
Count me in through thick and thin
Or it don't count
When you count the ones that want you
Count me, too
And if I'm not first on your list
Count me blue
Just be sure you count on me
And when the countings through
Count me madly in love with you"

And said that she was very, very cold
I kissed her goodnight
At her door and started home
Then thought about my sweater
And went right back instead
I knocked at her door and a man appeared
I told why I'd come, then he said:
""You're wrong, son
You weren't with my daughter
How can you be so cruel
To come to me this way?
My Laurie left this world on her birthday -
She died a year ago today.""

And then I looked and saw my sweater

How the music can free her whenever it starts?
And it's magic if the music is groovy
It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
But it's like tryna tell a stranger 'bout-a rock and roll

If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen, and it'll start with a smile
That won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start tapping, and you can't seem to find
How you got there so just blow your mind


If you believe in magic, come along with me
We'll dance until morning till there's just you and me
And maybe, if the music is right
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
And we'll go dancing, baby, then you'll see
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me

Yeah
Do you believe in magic?
Yeah
Believe in the magic of the young girl's soul
Believe in the magic of-a rock and roll
Believe in the magic that can set you free
Ohh, talking 'bout the magic

(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe, believer?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?

Pen house suit got the flashing lights
I don't give a fuck if my album drops
I'm a platinum in the streets I've got a thousand shots
All I do is make money I don't chase women
Hopped out the coup ten chains swinging
Chill on my block build a paper plane
I'm in the streets to race, no sega game
Everyday is the same, they changed the name
But I'm still slanging up in taylor's lane
I'm the club with a strally on my waist line
Holds 12 but is guaranteed to spray nine
They wanna know when the mix-tapes coming out
While I'm hoping these bricks ain't running out
Filling out the clientèle, giving out free yays
Stepping on the powder, cocaine dj'ing
Moving keys but I keep loosing p's
And I hardly get high cah I'm immune to cheese
My p's going up and down like sand in an hour glass
Call me Mr Burns I'm the man with the power-plant
I'll be chilling with my young bucks
30K on my neck, swinging like some nun-chucks
Chilling on the strip bait, but I'm out here spending like at this rate
I got the Nina I don't lift weights
I paint pictures, I'm nice with the words
The only thing cheap about me is the price on them words
Close your eyes when I get in the zone
Got a quarter 'mil line this ain't a regular phone,
They be watching my p's, I'm stocked up with cheese
It stinks so I gotta spray my block with febreeze
If them hoes ever see how I knock off them keys
When I tell them give me brain they will drop to their knees
Go over seas, get my mind straight
Left my workers with a line and 2 keys, something light weight
Certified trap-star, I ain't gotta say it
And I don't ever see the food, I let my shotters weigh it
Hoes looking at the pinky when I change gears
I'm out here moving onions, these ain't tears
With the AK, ill hit you up from long range
Got my weight up, a couple friends have gone strange
Just spend 7G's to make a 1000 back
My neighbours see them birds flying out the trap
Get your facts straight before you diss my team
And I ain't got a girlfriend, I sold that bitch a dream
Lord forgive me, I done a lot of dirt
I break down keys so this rap shit ain't gotta work
I stay on my grind, my work rate great
Tell a bitch if she ain't fucking on the first date skate
Them hoes are pinging but I ain't replying
Cah my phone keeps ringing, I'm always supplying
If I go pen, I'm shooting grade on the wing
And its looking like I spilled lucozade on my ring
5 bricks gone in one day, I trap hard
The mix-tape got more bangers than a scrap yard
Whoever thought I'd me moving these bricks
Copped a Q then I blew like a Crip
Must be crazy if you think my jewels are fake
Every time my phone rings I'm loosing weight
Its like I gotta ride out on my jack jones
Cah man ah keep talk bait on the tapped phones
I don't care about views on the net
Hands on cah my workers ain't moving correct
Heavy jewels on my neck, so I cruise with a tech
And if I pull it out, I'll leave your goons on the deck
Ask about me, I've been in birds view
Still hungry like the day I bought my first Q
Times have changed if them paigans have switched sex
I sold a billion O's but I ain't rich yet
Chilling on my block, bare clowns about
They werent around when I was in the bookie, down and out
Happy when I went broke and I had to consign a 7
How you like me now? I pull up in a 9/11
I ain't made a wack song yet
Told my youngers to put me a chain, stacks on deck
Im A'Jd out, used to wear denim clothes
Niggas thought ill never blow when I started selling draws
Wrapping out all night im soo knackered
Me and lil T, united like Old Trafford
With my delivery, if I was in this industry id clearly sell
But im caught up in this scary world, ain't no fairy tale"

As I walk this land of broken dreams
I have visions of many things
But happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion

What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Maybe

The roots of love grow all around
But for me they come a tumblin' down
Every day heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer

I walk in shadows searching for light
Cold and alone no comfort in sight
Hoping and praying for someone to care
Always moving and going nowhere

What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Help me

I'm searching though I don't succeed
But someone look, there's a growing need
All is lost, there's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending

Now what becomes of the broken-hearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
I'll be searching everywhere
Just to find someone to care

I'll be looking everyday
I know I'm gonna find a way
Nothing's gonna stop me now
I'll find a way somehow
I'll be searching everywhere"

He'll spend his very last dime
Tryin' to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way
It ought to be
Well, this man loves you, woman
I gave you everything I had
Tryin' to hold on to your heartless love
Baby, please don't treat me bad
When a man loves a woman
Down deep in his soul
She can bring him such misery

Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day
I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black
No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

What full lips you have
They're sure to lure someone bad
So until you get to grandma's place
I think you ought to walk with me and be safe

I'm gonna keep my sheep suit on
Until I'm sure that you've been shown
That I can be trusted walking with you alone

But you might think I'm a big bad wolf so I won't

Every morning I would see her
Waiting at the stop
Sometimes she'd shop
And she would show me what she'd bought
Other people stared
As if we were both quite insane
Someday my name and hers
Are going to be the same
That's the way the whole thing started
Silly but it's true
Thinking of our sweet romance
Beginning in a Queue
Came the sun
The ice was melting
No more sheltering now
Nice to think that that umbrella
Led me to avow

In a deep and dark December
I am alone
Gazing from my window
To the streets below
On a freshly fallen, silent shroud of snow

I am a rock
I am an island

I’ve built walls
A fortress, steep and mighty
That none may penetrate
I have no need of friendship
Friendship causes pain
It’s laughter and it’s loving I disdain

I am a rock
I am an island

Don’t talk of love
Well, I’ve heard the word before
It’s sleeping in my memory
I won’t disturb the slumber
Of feelings that have died
If I never loved, I never would have cried

I am a rock
I am an island

I have my books
And my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor
Hiding in my room
Safe within my womb
I touch no one and no one touches me

I am a rock
I am an island

And a rock feels no pain
And an island never cries"

I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by
The flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"", said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words, like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said:
""The words of the prophets are
Written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sound of silence."""

I'm a poor man's son, from across the railroad tracks
The only shirt I own is hanging on my back
But I'm the envy of every single guy
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye
When we go out stepping on the town for a while
My money's low and my suit's out of style
But it's all right if my clothes aren't new
Out of sight because my heart is true

She says baby everything is alright, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight

She's a pearl of a girl, I guess that's what you might say
I guess her folks brought her up that way
The right side of the tracks, she was born and raised
In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids
She says no one is better than I, I know I'm just an average guy
No football hero or smooth Don Juan
Got empty pockets, you see I'm a poor man's son
Can't give her the things that money can't buy
But I'll never, never make my baby cry

And it's all right, what I can't do
Out of sight because my heart is true

For every single thrill, there's another heartache
The road is rough
The going gets tough

Yes, love is a hurtin' thing
Oh, love is a hurtin' thing

When you're in my arms, I'm a king on a throne
But when we're apart, I walk the streets alone
On one day, happiness
The next day, loneliness

Love is a hurtin' thing
Oh, love is a hurtin' thing

When love brings so much joy, why must it bring such pain?
Guess it's a mystery that nobody can explain

Maybe I'm a fool to keep on loving you
'Cause there may come a time you'll break my heart in two
But I want you so
I want you, though I know that

Love is a hurtin' thing
Oh, love is a hurtin' thing"

Of telling tales and biting nails are gone
But in my mind
I know they will still live on and on
But how do you thank someone
Who has taken you from crayons to perfume?
It isn't easy, but I'll try
If you wanted the sky
I would write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high
""To Sir, with love""
The time has come
For closing books and long last looks must end
And as I leave
I know that I am leaving my best friend
A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong, that's a lot to learn
What, what can I give you in return?
If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a start
But I would rather you let me give my heart
To Sir, with love"

I was out choppin' cotton, and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And mama hollered out the back door, ""y'all, remember to wipe your feet!""
And then she said, ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge
Today, Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""
And papa said to mama, as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well, Billie Joe never had a lick of sense; pass the biscuits, please
There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
And mama said it was shame about Billie Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge
And brother said he recollected when he, and Tom, and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talking to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece-a apple pie; you know, it don't seem right
I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge
And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""
And mama said to me, ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?
I've been cookin' all morning, and you haven't touched a single bite
That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today
Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way
He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge
And she and Billie Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""
A year has come and gone since we heard the news 'bout Billie Joe
And brother married Becky Thompson; they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round; papa caught it, and he died last spring
And now mama doesn't seem to want to do much of anything
And me - I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge"

You know my papa disapproved it
My mama boo-hooed it
But I told them time and time again
""Don't you know I was made to love her
Build my world all around her""
Yeah! Hey, hey, hey

She's been my inspiration
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grew sweeter through the years

I know that my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her
Hey, hey, hey

All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby, hey
My baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I ain't going nowhere

I was knee-high to a chicken
When that love bug bit me
I had the fever with each passing year
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
By her side I'll still be standing there

'Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live for her, yeah!
Ah, I was made to love her
Build my world all around her
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh baby, I was made to please her
You know Stevie ain't gon' leave her, no
Hey, hey, hey, ooh wee, baby"

Locked your love away from me

Look at me
See what loving you has done to me
Look at my face
See how cryin' has left its trace

After you made me all your own
Then you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love, I couldn't keep

My heart cries out for your touch
But you're not there
And the lonely cry fades in the air

Until love took a detour
Yeah, riding high on top of the world
It happened, suddenly it just happened
I saw my dreams fall apart
When love walked away from my heart
And when you lose that precious love you need
To guide you
Something happens inside you, the happening

Now I see life for what it is
It's not all dreams, ooh, it's not all bliss
It happened to me and it can happen to you

Once
Ooh, and then it happened
Ooh, and then it happened
Ooh, and then it happened
Ooh, and then it happened

Is it real, is it fake
Is this game of life a mistake?
'Cause when I lost the love I thought was mine
For certain, suddenly I started hurting
I saw the light too late
When that fickle finger of fate
Yeah, came and broke my pretty balloon
I woke up
Suddenly I just woke up to the happening

So sure, I felt secure
Until love took a detour
'Cause when you got a tender love you don't
Take care of, then you better beware of"

First and foremost, Gaye was a Christian artist. He was also one of the most gifted performers produced by the Afro-American religious experience. Raised in his father's Pentecostal church, located in the East Capitol projects in Washington, D.C., Gaye was imbued with a deep spiritual sensitivity anchored in a Christ-centered ethic of love. Initially this sensitivity was expressed in his instrumental virtuosity -- especially on the organ, piano, and drums. Althought Gaye sang in the church choir, his vocal talent did not surface until he filled the first-tenor slot of Harvey Fuqua's Moonglows, a smooth-harmony rhythm and blues group. When Gaye's silky and soulful voice caught the attention of Berry Gordy, Jr. -- the founder of Motown Recording Company -- in a Detroit nightclub in 1961, he was immediately offered a contract. The public career of Marvin Gaye had begun.
Motown was the Jackie Robinson of black popular music: after crossing the color line it its field, it went on to excel and to win the hearts of vast numbers of nonblack Americans. As with other Motown stars -- Diana Ross, Lionel Richie and Michael Jackson -- Gaye's relationship with Motown enabled his talent to become visible to the world. Unlike those other artists, Gaye's musical and philosophical roots remained in the Afro-American Christian tradition. His first classic recordings were neither adolescent, rhythmic dance records (as with the Supremes and the Jackson Five) nor funky rock renderings (as with Lionel Richie's Commodores). Rather, Gaye's great early achievements -- sung with the incomparable Tammi Terrell -- were poignant and powerful love songs, written by the team of Nickolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson of White Rock Baptist Church in New York City. These classics -- such as ""Your Precious Love,"" ""Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing,"" ""You're All I Need to Get By"" and ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" -- were the pivotal songs that directed the Christian relgiosity of black church music into the secular spirituality of Afro-American popular music. For the first time in American history, the musical depth of the black church was let loose into the mainstream of American society. And American popular music would never again be the same.
Upon the tragic death of Tammi Terrell, who collapsed in Gaye's arms during a performance in 1967, Gaye went into hiding. Despite his success as a solo performer (""I'll Be Doggone,"" ""Ain't That Peculiar,"" and ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine"" all reached the Top Ten), Gaye became reclusive, melancholic and deeply dissatisfied with his music. He would not perform publicly for five years.
""WHAT'S GOING ON""
Yet Gaye's tortuous struggle with the sudden death of Tammi Terrell, his younger brother Frankie's firsthand accounts of atrocities in Vietnam, the escalation of the civil rights movement into black power advocacy, the widespread invasion of drugs among unemployed black youth and the rise of ecological consciousness produced the greatest album in Afro-American popular music: What's Going On (1971). This groundbreaking album was not only the first conceived and enacted by the artist (as opposed to studio staffers), but also the first concept album that hung together by means of a set of themes -- themes concerned with socio-economic critique and Christian outlook.
Gaye's critique of American society was explicit. ""Rockets, moon shots,"" he wrote in ""Inner City Blues,"" ""Spend it on the have-nots."" With ""radiation underground and in the sky,"" he saw birds and animals dying in ""Mercy, Mercy Me (The Ecology)."" Instead of brutality, he asked attention: ""Talk to me, so you can see"" (""What's Going On""). And in such songs as ""Save the Children,"" ""God Is Love"" and ""Wholly Holy,"" he explicitly evoked the love ethic of Jesus Christ as the basis for negating and transforming the world: If we learn from the book jesus left us, we can rock the world, we can ""holler love across the nation.""
What's Going On was the peak of Gaye's career. He continued to produce popular albums and hits. Yet, principally owing to two painful divorces, Oedipal obsessions, paranoiac fits and suicidal impulses, Gaye became captive to a form of bondage he admonished others to avoid: drugs. His songs still portrayed a longing for transcendence, but instead of the agapic praxis of communities he highlighted erotic communion -- as in his albums Let's Get It On (1973) and I Want You and his Grammy Award single ""Sexual Healing"" (1982).
In his last years, Gaye oscillated between earthly pessimism and eschatological hope: from the notion that nuclear holocaust was imminent to a faith that only Jesus can save us. During his sporadic bouts with suicide, Gaye is reported to have viewed Jesus and sins that would never be forgiven as the primary motivations to live. And, at the height of this turmoil, the last words he wrote for his laste album, Midnight Love (1982), were ""I still love Jesus, all praises to the Heavenly Father."" May this troubled musical genius, deeply immersed in the Afro-American religious experience and genuinely sensitive to the harsh realities of American society, rest in peace. And may his artistic Christian witness live forever."

Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor

The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale


She said, there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might have just as well've been closed

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale


She said, 'I'm home on shore leave,'
Though in truth we were at sea
So I took her by the looking glass
And forced her to agree
Saying, 'You must be the mermaid
Who took Neptune for a ride.'
But she smiled at me so sadly
That my anger straightway died

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

If music be the food of love
Then laughter is its queen
And likewise if behind is in front
Then dirt in truth is clean
My mouth by then like cardboard
Seemed to slip straight through my head
So we crash-dived straightway quickly
And attacked the ocean bed

And so it was that later

That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale"

To the happy times
Oh, when you were mine
As I peer through the window
Of lost time
Looking over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain
(All the love) All the love
That I've wasted
(All the tears) All the tears
That I've tasted
All in vain
Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt
That you have caused
Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects the love that used to be
In you I put
All my faith and trust
Right before my eyes
My world has turned to dust
After all the nights
I sat alone and wept
Just a handful of promises
Are all that's left of loving you
Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me
In you I put
All my faith and trust
Right before my eyes
My world has turned to dust"

The harps of the bards are silenced; the warriors are ranged in two long files; the gates of the palace are flung open, and the aged Morna appears between his two sons, Lémor and Armin. The
p. 151
people flock to gaze on their king, and welcome him with acclamations of deep affection, because Morna is the well beloved of all, as his name signifies in the harmonious language of the verdant isles. The hair and beard of the king are white, but the snow of seventy winters has been powerless to bend the limbs of the athlete king, well developed by labour and a sober life. The loving people have also a welcome for the princes who accompany the ancient, for beautiful in body and soul are Lémor and Armin. Lémor possesses a face that is fair to behold as the snow which crowns the heights of Carmora; his hair is golden as the rays of the sun, and his eyes are blue like the flower of the flax. They depart from Témora, followed by the warriors and blessed by the women. The old men and the children gaze after their retreating forms with loving eyes and hearts until they become lost in the woods of Lena. But they are not proceeding to war--no--for see, the women do not weep on beholding their departure. The wild boar, of rough skin and long tusks, is the enemy against which they are going to wrestle in the forests of Lena. See them as they become lost in the fastnesses as soon as the dogs announce the presence of the giant of the woods. The king goes one way, and Lémor and Armin go another. The bugle of the keepers also announce the appearance of the wild boar. And the boar runs, runs, runs, destroying with his formidable
p. 152
tusks every dog which dares to approach him, repelling all the arrows directed against his hard rough skin. Lémor has separated himself from his brother as he had done previously from his father, and one hour had already been spent by the tired-out huntsmen in scouring the dense wood unable to vanquish the boar. The bugle announces to Lémor that the animal is running towards where he is, and the gallant huntsman prepares his bow. The tangled brushwood is seen moving at a short distance from him; the enormous head of the boar is descried, and the arrow of Lémor pierces the air. A cry of pain is heard, and Lémor hastens to despatch the animal; but the boar is not in the spot aimed at by the arrow, and the cry of pain is repeated some distance further. Lémor advances, and on separating the tangled growth of briars and brushwood behind which issued the wail, a cry of immense sorrow bursts from his breast on seeing that his father, the king of the green isles, the beloved of all, and of none more than of Lémor, is lying on the ground in a dying condition, his noble breast pierced by the dart shot from the bow of Lémor. Lémor beseeches help for his father, invoking the protection of heaven in behalf of the dying old man endeavours to return back his life--that life which is fast ebbing away--and he weeps on seeing his impotence, and his soul is filled with despair.
p. 153
II.
They are returning to the palace of Témora, the princes of the Emerald Isles, and the warriors who went with them to the woods of Lena; but the bards who went out to receive them, when they perceived them returning in the far distance, do not strike their golden harps, nor do they welcome the huntsmen with songs of praise. Silent and sorrowful do the huntsmen and the bards arrive, and on learning the cause of this silence and grief the women and the old men and the children fill the air with their laments and their wails of sorrow. Morna, the beloved of all, returns, a lifeless body, conducted by his warriors, laid on a litter of funereal cypress, and Lémor and Armin appear to be dying of grief. The ancients, the chieftains of the tribes of Erin, assemble together on the following day in Témora, and after a long conference they come and stand before Lémor, the heir to the sovereignty of the Emerald Isles.
""Prince,"" spoke the oldest of the chiefs, ""although by our laws a parricide is condemned to death, thou must not die, because, if thine arrow did wound thy father, it was not done willingly; but the crown must not be placed on the brow of one who is stained with the blood of his father and of his king, nor can he dwell amongst us. The crown of Morna must rest on the stainless
p. 154
brow of Armin. To-morrow at daybreak a ship will await thee in port provisioned and manned. Depart in her for ever from our isles, and may heaven protect thee wheresoever the wind and wave may take thee to!""
Lémor accedes to the decision of the chieftains of the tribes, and delivers himself up to the mercy of the winds and of the waves, with no better company than his own sorrow, his hope in heaven which knew his innocence, and two loyal servitors who had willed to share his misfortunes.
The ship, deficient of a skilful pilot, sailed on for days and nights and even months upon the boundless solitudes of the ocean, cast about like a toy at the mercy of swelling waves and the fury of the winds. Thirst at length begins to parch up Lémor and his servitors, who have no more water to drink or to cool their parched lips but the salt sea water. But just as the last ray of hope of discovering land had been extinguished, and they had abandoned all idea of meeting with the shore of any country whatever, they perceived in the far distance, amid the sea mists, a coast backed by green mountains, and they pushed on their ship towards that blessed land. That land was the one inhabited by the Cantabrians, 1 the race of giants which, five centuries
p. 155
earlier, Rome, the mistress of the world, had been unable to vanquish despite all her power.
The ship is closely approaching the shore. Beautiful is the land before them; more beautiful even than the isles of Erin is the continent which the prince and his loyal servitors hail with joy. The exiles leap from the ship on to the land and burst out in shouts of joy, because beneath the shade of some immense leafy chestnut trees they perceive a fountain of running water, clear as the crystalline roofs of the grottoes of Drumanar. The fresh water calms the heat which devours them. Peace comes over the soul, and sleep visits their weary eyelids. They cast themselves on a green slope covered with flowers, and soon fall asleep.
III.
Where goes the echeco-jauna 1 of Bustuna as he abandons the cultivation of his fields and descends to the deserted shores of Mundaca, followed by those who were assisting him at his work? Where goes the echeco-jauna in such haste?
From the mountain heights he has seen a little ship tossed by the waves and dashing itself against the rocks, and, as his heart is compassionate and hospitable he runs, flies to succour the wrecked ones whom he
p. 156
supposes must be battling with death on the shore. He stops as he descends to the plain, and those who came with him also. Three strangers are sleeping close to the fountain under the shade of the chestnut trees, and the echeco-jauna remains there in order to watch over and guard their steep.
The sons of the green isles awake, and they ask of the echeco-jauna what land that is which the winds and the waves have brought them to in their ship. And on learning that it is the land of the invincible Cantabrians, they raise their lips to heaven and thank God for having conducted them to the country of the first heroes of the universe. Under the roof of Bustuna they find an hospitable asylum, those exiles from Erin; but very quickly does it become known throughout the Euskarian mountains that among them dwells a son of kings, and the aged Lekobide, the chieftain of the Eskaldunac, 1 and descendant of the glorious leader of the same name who humbled the pride of the Cæsars, and whom the Basque people sing praises in their songs, sends messengers to the Prince of Erin to offer him a home in the valley of Padura.
p. 157
Lémor contemplates with delight the supreme happiness of the land on reaching the dwelling of the Basque chieftain. An aureole of glory encircles the venerable brow of Lekobide, and another of beauty and chastity that of the youthful Luz, the daughter of the chieftain of the Eskaldunac.
Months have passed since Lémor came to dwell in the home of Lekobide, and for months has he been striving to quit the valley of Padura, because as a good knight and a good Christian he is ashamed to live in idleness meanwhile that the sons of Agar are trampling on the holy cross beyond the Ebro. For months has he wished to offer his arm to Fernan Gonzalez, the Count de Castile, but he is always held back by the pleadings of Luz and Lekobide; and, more than all, is he detained by a mysterious power which dwells in his heart. Warlike exercises and the chase restrains his steps. When departing from Padura he wends his steps towards the lofty mountains that command the view of the valley to pursue the wild boar and the deer, Luz goes to the window with saddened looks to watch the stranger from the valley, and the stranger turns back seeking Luz at the window.
IV.
The Eskaldunac are free, free as the breeze and the birds of their mountains. They have no lord to whom
p. 158
they owe vassalage, nor do they possess other laws than those written in the consciences of their chiefs, who judge the culprit and adjust contentions under the shadow of the holy tree of Guernica. Beyond the hierarchy of virtue and of intelligence and of age, there is but one hierarchy in the land of the Eskaldunac. The Eskaldunac elect a chief who is ever ready to lead them to the combat whenever the stranger invades their free land; and this glorious title they bestowed on Lekobide more than half a century before in consideration of his virtue, his intelligence, his valour, and his glorious name.
One day, when the Euskaro patricians were assembled together under the holy oak of Guernica, one of them remarked that Lekobide was aged and impotent, and therefore incapable to take the command of the armies of the Eskaldunac on the day when the stranger should invade the land. Then a patrician of a century old spoke in the name of the assembly:
""Fifteen years have passed since Leyalá, the most valiant and loyal dog of our mountains, watched day and night at the door of his master. ""Leyalá is old,"" said one day the echeco-jauna, and on that night a new guardian was installed in the post in which Leyalá had grown old.
""The fox which had been scared away from afar by Leyalá fifteen years ago, and which he had scented
p. 159
from a great distance, came that very night, unfelt by the young dog, and ate up the fowls of the echeco-jauna. And Leyalá, who, sad and broken in heart, had left the fern-bed in which he had slept for fifteen years at the door of the homestead, in order that a stranger should occupy his post, was found dead on the following morning, although the echeco-jauna had prepared a bed for him softer and more sheltered than the one in which he had lain for fifteen years.""
Thus spoke the patrician of a century old, and since then no one ever remarked that Lekobide was aged. Neither Lekobide himself remembered his age, because the youthfulness of his spirit does not permit him to think on the age of his strong arm.
But hark! a low rumour is heard, and an unusual agitation unknown for years spreads across the valleys and along the range of the Basque mountains, and numerous scouts, their hearts full of indignation, hasten to the door of Lekobide, calling out--
""Quidaria! 1 a formidable army appears on the cordillera of Orduña, and alas! for the Eskaldunac, should the irrinzi 2 not be quickly heard on our mountains.
Lekobide rises up brimming over with wrath. ""Blow the five bugle-horns on the five Basque mountains; for
p. 160
none must reach the Tree Malato of those who would dare in warfare to trample down our free dwellings! Give me my coat of mail, and the lance which seventy years ago accompanied me to the combat!"" And Lekobide quickly puts on the coat of mail, and his body bends beneath the weight of his armour. Lekobide grasps the lance, but his arm is powerless to hold it. Then does the glorious chieftain remember his age and trembles; and, humbled and despairing, he falls down at the threshold of the door.
Meanwhile the alarm flies along the Basque mountains and valleys, and in answer to the call to war many Basque warriors are coming down to the valley of Padura, imploring their revered chieftain to lead them to battle. A ray of hope suddenly illumines the venerable countenance of Lekobide which had been so full of despair.
""Prince of Erin cried the old man, addressing the son of Morna, ""take my coat of mail and my lance, and fill my place of command at the head of the Euskaro legions!""
""Señor!"" replies Lémor, ""I will fight against the enemies of thy land in which I have received such generous hospitality, but it will be in the soldier's ranks. Seek a chieftain more worthy than I to lead thy warriors to the combat.""
All the Euscarian warriors who had descended from
p. 161
the mountains to the valley of Padura joined their pleadings to those of Lekobide, but the modest Prince of Erin insists on marching to war only on condition of fighting. in the ranks with the humblest wrestler.
""As long as thou livest, thou wilt be the leader and champion of the Eskaldunac, because I am powerless to be so,"" said Lekobide, with universal assent; but Lémor still continues to refuse to accept the glorious title offered to him.
""Thou art the son of kings, and art worthy to command vassals,"" exclaim the ancients of the twenty valleys gathered together in the valley of Padura; ""the free land of the Euskaro confers upon thee the sovereignty if thou dost consent to take the command of our armies.""
The prince of the green isles refuses the sovereignty of the Eskaldunac. And while all this contention takes place, more scouts appear on the field to announce that the army of the enemy has passed the Tree Malato, and are descending the mountain slopes, like a raging sea, carrying all that opposes its progress.
""Oh, Prince of Erin!"" cries Lekobide, ""if in my veins flowed the blood of kings I would then tell thee--Lead the Eskaldunac legions on to battle, cast out of our free land the stranger, and on returning from the combat thou wilt sit at my hearth, and I will bestow on thee the title of son!""
p. 162
Lémor directed a glance full of love and hope towards Luz; and, as though he had read on the brow of the maiden the reply his soul yearned to hear, he cried out, as he donned the coat of mail and grasped the lance of Lekobide:
""Old man! may God permit me to be seated at thy hearth and hear from thy lips the name of son!""
V.
Upon the five highest mountains of the free land is heard the blast of the trumpets, and that warlike sound is answered throughout the valleys and mountains by the powerful irrinzi. Every man with sufficient strength to cast an arrow, wield the sword, the lance, or battleaxe, speedily rises up, quits his house, and proceeds toward the valley of Padura, whose plains and heights can scarcely hold the thousands of Basques that are collecting together in answer to the call of their Country. This call or summons is not issued without good cause, for the enemies are many, and they are already approaching the valley of Padura as though to challenge the chieftain, who they are well aware dwells there.
The armies which invade the Basque mountains are not composed of those brave legions of Castile and Leon, who so often planted the cross of Christ over the tents of the Mussulman; nor are they led by the kings
p. 163
of Leon or the Counts of Castile. These legions are composed of low adventurers, who defame the Christian name from the banks of the Ebro to the shores of the Tagus, and are commanded by Ordoño the Wicked, the vile usurper of the crown of Sancho el Craso, and who, cast forth from his Leonese throne, wishes to drown his disappointment in the noble blood of the Eskaldunac, and raise up on the Basque mountains a new throne upon which to sit.
The Basque army, led by Jaun-Zuria, as the people style the Prince of Erin, goes out to encounter the stranger, who is already appearing on the mountain heights that overlook the valley of Padura, and Sancho de Esteguiz, the lord of the Duranguesado, leaves his palace of Tarisa to lead the Duranguese, who are longing to fight by the side of their brother tribes, commanded by the prince. The combat is a fierce one, and its frightful din thunders throughout the hitherto peaceful mountains of the Euskaros. A dense cloud of arrows obscures the sunlight, enormous boulders of rocks wrenched by the herculean arms of the Eskaldunac are cast upon the armies of Ordoño, dismembering and crushing and terrifying them. The axe and the lance, the swords of the Basque warriors are fast cutting down the invading legions on the broken rocks of Padura. But the desperation of Ordoño incites him to make a supreme effort to reanimate
p. 164
the courage of the adventurers, and the victory is still undecided.
""Death to the leader of the Eskaldunac!"" cries Ordoño, ""and then the victory will be ours!"" And he runs to encounter Jaun-Zuria, who at the same time fights, and commands his army in the thickest of the fray.
The son of the kings of Erin goes out in his turn to meet the ambitious chief of the invaders, and closes with him in a fierce match. The lance of Lekobide, wielded with Titanic force by the Prince of Erin, pierces through the breast of Ordoño, who expires uttering a roar of desperation which resounds throughout the mountains of Padura like that of a wounded lion. But alas! a stone flung by the enemy wounds the noble forehead of the lord of the Duranguesado, for whose life the Prince of Erin would willingly have given his own!
Disorder reigns now in the disbanded legions of the stranger, and they flee in terror back from whence they came, marking their footprints with blood and fire. The Eskaldunac follow them to the cordillera of Ordoño, and there, wearied with so much slaughter, and beholding their country once more happy and free, they return to rest and to celebrate their glorious triumph beneath the shades of the Tree Malato.
p. 165
VI.
Nearly ten centuries have passed since the Eskaldunac, led by the exile of Erin, sent a thrill of joy and triumph among the people on the fields of Padura. Should you desire to visit these fields, do not seek on the map for the name of Padura, because they have changed this name for that of Arrigorriaga, which in the rich and venerable language of the Euskaro is equivalent to reddened stones. The rocks which bristle on the tops of the mountains of the ancient Padura presented for a long time the colour of the blood which the hordes of Ordoño the Wicked poured upon them, and for this reason was the ancient name of Padura altered to that of Arrigorriaga.
Proceed to the parochial church of the valley of Arrigorriaga, and there, close to the font of holy water, you will see a sepulchre. Ask the simple villager who it is that reposes in that sepulchre, and he will tell you that there lies a prince called Ordoño, who strove to rob the Basque people of their liberties, and was killed by Jaun-Zuria, the first Lord of Biscay. After this, examine the dusty archives of the temple, and if you understand the changeless and eternal language of the Eskaldunac, you may read in some worm-eaten parchments, yellowed by age, that in this temple were joined together the daughter of Lekobide with the son of a King of Erin."

In the pouring rain
Very strange

There beneath the blue suburban skies

In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain
Very strange

—Sade, “Pearls”
 Never believe that a few caring people can't change the world.
For, indeed, that's all who ever have.
—Margaret Mead
I will donate all of my proceeds from The Hard Thing About Hard Things to American Jewish World Service to support their efforts to help women fight for their basic rights throughout the world.
Since there are many important causes, I thought that it would be worth explaining why I am supporting this one.
When I was 11 years old, I was exposed to chronic cruelty on a global scale. I watched the miniseries “Roots” based on Alex Haley's bestselling novel about slavery in the United States. I was riveted and horrified. It was my first real introduction to slavery and I could not believe what I was seeing. I saw families broken apart as they were sold to different owners. I saw slaves pleading for their lives only to be brutalized and killed. How could anybody be so cruel? How could everybody sit by and watch it happen? How was this even possible? I could not have been more shocked.
I was deeply disturbed by the whole experience and sought to find out how it happened. I studied humankind's long history with slavery. I learned that in the 1600s, 75% of the world's population was enslaved. I learned that the Caribbean form of the African slave trade was far more brutal than the U.S. version. I studied the complex economics of slavery and why it was difficult to unwind once started. I began to wonder how slavery ever ended.
Then I began to study the abolitionists. Men like former slave ship captain John Newton who later wrote the song “Amazing Grace”. People like the great Thomas Clarkson who at times seemed to be alone in taking on the world. I learned how a few unimaginably brave people took on the entire globe and its brutal institution. They did not care about the twisted history or corrupt cultures that created slavery. They just wanted it stopped. Clarkson took great personal risk in traveling by boat back and forth across the Atlantic to record and tell the story of slavery for no reason other than he wanted it ended. He dedicated his life to stopping the cruelty. His story is among the most inspirational in human history.
It had to be, because the most incredible thing about slavery was how it ended. An institution that was embedded into human culture, endorsed by the Bible, promoted by the Qur’an, pervasive in society, and embedded in the global economy was taken on and defeated by a movement started by a tiny number of people. These brave souls had no Twitter or Facebook. They had no Internet or telephones or automobiles, but they organized people across the world and largely stopped slavery globally.
After understanding how slavery ended, I promised myself that if something like that ever happened in my time, I would be part of the group who tried to stop it.
Sadly, something like slavery is happening in my time. It's not happening in the United States, but it is happening and the victims are women. In many parts of the world, women are literally owned by men. Women do not enjoy basic rights, are denied access to education, can be arbitrarily raped, robbed, and killed, and live in fear with no chance for self-determination. A few revealing statistics:
- Every year 10 million girls under the age 18 enter into early and forced marriages
- 2 million girls a year undergo genital cutting
- Two-thirds of the world's illiterate adults are women
- Women constitute about 70% of the world’s absolute poor (i.e., those living on less than a dollar a day)
Meanwhile, the rhetoric deployed in resistance to women's rights is eerily reminiscent of resistance to freeing slaves. Consider this statement from the Muslim Brotherhood in resistance to a U.N. declaration calling for an end to violence against women:
This declaration, if ratified, would lead to complete disintegration of society, and would certainly be the final step in the intellectual and cultural invasion of Muslim countries, eliminating the moral specificity that helps preserve cohesion of Islamic societies.
And compare it to this poem written in defense of slavery in England in 1789:
If our slave trade had gone, there's an end to our lives
Beggars all we must be, our children and wives
No ships from our ports, their proud sails e'er would spread,
And our streets grown with grass where the cows might be fed.
Like Thomas Clarkson and the abolitionists, Ruth Messinger and AJWS are starting at the grass roots level, but are already making great progress.
Consider Rehana Adib. At age 12, she was raped by a group of older relatives. She bravely told her father, but he responded by arranging for her to marry a middle-aged man—a match designed to protect her security and reputation. Like many other girls her age, she was forced to drop out of school and was expected to be a subservient wife and mother. She was not free to make choices about her daily life and her own future.
But Rehana refused to be silent. She found a women’s organization in her neighborhood and began to learn about her rights. She took workshops in leadership and activism and gained the courage to speak out about her experiences. By the time Rehana was 18, she was an active member of the local women’s movement and was already helping other girls overcome the challenges they faced. Although her family and community criticized her work at first, she slowly gained their respect and is now looked to as a leader in her community.
In 2005, Rehana founded her own organization, Astitva, in Muzzafarnagar—a rural area in Uttar Pradesh, India. With AJWS’s support, Astitva works today to stop both sexual violence and child marriage, helping give girls a chance at a brighter future.
The systematic cultural abuse of women worldwide must end. Let’s end it.

In the clear blue skies over Germany
Came a roar and a thunder men had never heard
Like the scream and the sound of a big war bird
Up in the sky, a man in a plane
Baron von Richthofen was his name
Eighty men tried, and eighty men died
Now they're buried together on the countryside

Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty or more
The Bloody Red Baron was rolling out the score
Eighty men died trying to end that spree
Of the Bloody Red Baron of Germany

In the nick of time, a hero arose
A funny-looking dog with a big black nose
He flew into the sky to seek revenge
But the Baron shot him down (Curses, foiled again!)


Now, Snoopy had sworn that he'd get that man
So he asked the Great Pumpkin for a new battle plan
He challenged the German to a real dogfight
While the Baron was laughing, he got him in his sight

That Bloody Red Baron was in a fix
He'd tried everything, but he'd run out of tricks
Snoopy fired once, and he fired twice
And that Bloody Red Baron went spinning out of sight"

I touched your golden hair and tasted your perfume
Your eyes were filled with love the way they used to be
Your gentle hand reached out to comfort me
Then came the dawn
And you were gone
You were gone, gone, gone
I had too much to dream last night
Too much to dream
I'm not ready to face the light
I had too much to dream
Last night
The room was empty as I staggered from my bed
I could not bear the image racing through my head
You were so real that I could feel your eagerness
And when you raised your lips for me to kiss
Came the dawn
And you were gone
You were gone, gone, gone
Oh, too much to dream
Oh, too much to dream
Too much to dream last night
Oh, too much to dream"

(Wait a second)
You're gone now
I run to touch you, but you vanish through the doorway
And, oh, how
Hard it is to live without you
I love everything about you
Now I know you're really gone
But my imagination is so strong
That I see you coming into view
And your face is telling me that you
Oh, yeah, oh, want to be by my side
Oh, yeah, oh, now it's finally time
(Wait a second)
Mirage, that's all you are to me
Mirage, something I only see
So I keep walking through the alleys and the hallways
Where are you?
I keep remembering the kissing in the doorways
The car, too
How it all comes back to me
The movies every Saturday
The place we used to go to eat
I want so much to have it like it used to be
That I see you coming into view
And your face is telling me that you
Oh, yeah, oh, want to be by my side
Oh, yeah, oh, now it's finally time
(Here it comes again)
Mirage, that's all you are to me
Mirage, something I only see

As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my Mama and Papa
Down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home
Yes, they'll all come to meet me
Arms reaching, smiling sweetly
It's good to touch the green, green, grass of home
The old house is still standing
Tho' the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home
Yes, they'll all come to meet me
Arms reaching, smiling sweetly
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

Then I awake and look around me
At the four grey walls that surround me
And I realize, yes, I was only dreaming
For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre -
Arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak
Again I touch the green, green grass of home

Yes, they'll all come to see me in the shade
Of that old oak tree
As they lay me neath the green, green grass of home"
