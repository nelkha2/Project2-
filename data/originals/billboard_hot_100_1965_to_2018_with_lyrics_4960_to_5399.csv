Let's light it up like it's our last night

We're just hanging around
Burnin' it down
Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's
Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby
Laying right here naked in my bed
I'm just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl let's keep burnin' it down
Burnin' it down, burnin' it down

Girl when you want it
You know that I'm on it
You know that I love lovin' up on you
Let's hit the switch and let our shadows dance
And light it up like it's our last chance

We're just hanging around
Burnin' it down
Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's
Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby

Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Thinkin', ""no way she ain't got one""
Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

She was like, ""oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
She was like, ""come here, boy, I wanna dance!""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around till it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""
And I said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""

I'd gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up

She was like, ""oh my God, this is my song
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is""
She was like, ""come here boy, I wanna dance!""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""

And she said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""
The next Friday night we were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile when I broke out my guitar

She was like, ""oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
She was like, ""come here boy, I wanna dance!""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And she said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""
And I said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""

Yeah play it again, play it again, play it again
Somebody play it again, play it again, play it again"

But it was the first year Rosie started bringing my lunch out to the field every day

You get your hands in it
Plant your roots in it
Dusty headlight, dance with your boots in it (dirt)
You write her name on it
Spin your tires on it
Build your corn field, whiskey, bonfires on it (dirt)
You bet your life on it, yeah
It's that...

Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

Rosie and I had five children, one died at birth, they were tough times, tough years, did okay

You've mixed some sweat with it
Taking a shovel to it
You've stuck some crosses and some painted
Goal posts through it (dirt)
You know you came from it (dirt)
And some day you'll return to

Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

I asked Rosie one time if she wanted to travel to see the world, and no she said ""the world comes right to my window every day""... Even if it's broken
(You know you came from it (dirt, dirt) And some day you'll return to)

Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

See Rosie was right about two things: you don't have to see the world to be worldly, just raise good children, make good enough pies and the world will come right to your kitchen window. She's right about something else too, I built that baseball diamond way too close to the kitchen

And show me, how big your brave is

Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh

She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn’t wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour

Comin' down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about at all
No, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater, woah

Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'Cause it's too cold for you
Now, let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And it's too cold, it's too cold
The holes of my sweater"

Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

Now all the stars are turnin' blue, just kissed the clock 2:22
Baby, I know what you're wishin' for, I'm wishin' for it too
Now all the lights are flashin' gold, nobody cares how fast we go
Our soundtrack's in the stereo
The DJ's on a roll

We can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

Buzzin' like a streetlight
We can leave 'em on tonight"

A couple tickets all inclusive down in Cancun
I couldn't get my money back so I'm in seat 7A
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I bet the fella on the aisle thought I was crazy
Cause I taped your picture to the seatback right beside me
Now I've got empty mini bottles fillin' both our trays
I'm getting drunk on a plane

Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

We had this date marked on the calendar forever
We'd take that new wed limo airport ride together
I feel like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the cake
So hey, I'm getting drunk on a plane

Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737
Rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

On my way home I'll bump this seat right up to first class
So I can drink that cheap champagne out of a real glass
And when we land I'll call her up and tell her kiss my ass
Cause hey, I'm drunk on a plane

Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737
Rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

I'm getting drunk on a plane
I might be passed out
In the baggage claim
But right now
I'm drunk on a plane"

All my girls just keep on blowin' up my phone
Sayin', ""Come on, he ain’t worth the pain
Do what you gotta do to forget his name""
Now there’s only one thing left for me to do
Slip on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots
Check the mirror one last time
And kiss the past goodbye

What I’m really needin' now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender, pour ‘em hot tonight
‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it ‘til his memory fades away
Hey bartender

Tonight I’ll let a stranger pull me on the floor
Spin me 'round and let him buy a couple more
But before it goes too far
I’ll let him down easy
'Cause tonight it’s all about dancin' with my girls to the DJ
Put that song on replay

What I’m really needin' now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender, pour ‘em hot tonight
‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it ‘til his memory fades away
Hey bartender

I’m feelin' that buzz
I’m ready to rock
Ain’t no way I’m gonna tell you to stop
So pour that thing up to the top
I’m comin' in hot
Hey bartender
Ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh

Hey Bartender
What I’m really needin' now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender, pour ‘em hot tonight
‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it ‘til his memory fades away

I mean, it's almost unbearable
In a hundred years not dare would I
Pull a Pharcyde, let you pass me by
Nothin' like your last guy, he too square for you
He don't smack that ass and pull your hair like that
So I'm just watching and waitin'
For you to salute the true big pimpin'
Not many women can refuse this pimping

I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even though he’s right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you
Do you read the ones I wrote you?

Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all

I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all

The pictures that you sent me, they're still living in my phone
I admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around
It hurts to know you’re happy and it hurts that you moved on
It’s hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long

It’s like we never happened, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all

I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish, we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

If today I woke up with you right beside me
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never slip away
And you'd never hear me say

I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish, we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

'Cause I'm not fine at all
No, I'm really not fine at all
Tell me this is just a dream
'Cause I'm really not fine at all"

Produced by Noah ""40"" Shebib, the track features the usual suspects: Drake, Rick Ross, and Lil Wayne. A behind-the-scenes photo from this song's video shoot led to the ultra-famous ‘Drake Lean’ meme, one of the biggest memes of 2013! With an enthralling beat and a memorable hook, “No New Friends” was one of the most anthemic tracks of the year.84. Danny Brown ft. A$AP Rocky ""Kush Coma""83. Rick Ross ft. Future ""No Games""

One hit wonder or talented hit maker? That’s the question posed by Rich Homie Quan with his street anthem “Type of Way"". The song propelled the relatively unknown Atlanta native into the spotlight and a top 50 spot on Billboards Hot 100 after it was caught up by the streets and shared around the Internet - even Michigan State’s college football team is using it as their team anthem!54.

Joey Bada$$ “Unorthodox”Joey & Primo take it back to the golden age on this boom bap-esque joint. The minimalist production fits Joey’s flow perfectly and enables his complex delivery and dope bars to shine. Functioning as the first single from “Summer Knights”, Joey drops some surprises; explaining his reasoning behind not signing a major record deal and that he does verses for free!49.

Isaiah Rashad “Shot U Down (Remix)” ft. Jay Rock & Schoolboy Q”
TDE newcomer Isaiah Rashad’s best offering of 2013 came with this infectious hook laden remix of his original “I Shot U Down”. Featuring fellow TDE spitters Jay Rock & Schoolboy Q, the hard drums and longer verses propel the track to new heights. If it’s anything to go by, we could be looking at a future addition to the Black Hippy quartet.44. Childish Gambino “Sweatpants”
43. Tech N9ne “Fragile” ft. Kendrick Lamar, Kendall Morgan & ¡MAYDAY! 42. Mac Miller “Red Dot Music” ft. Action Bronson41. Jay Z “Oceans” ft. Frank Ocean40. J Cole “Forbidden Fruit” ft. Kendrick LamarAnother collaboration between good friends J. Cole and Kendrick Lamar led to one of the top singles off of Cole's album ""Born Sinner"". While Kendrick does not deliver a verse on it, the hook he gives us still is soothing and paints the religious theme throughout the song. Cole delivers two solid verses, talking about religion, his inner struggle, and even saying why he dropped his album the same day as Kanye West. One more from Lil Cole!39. Pusha T “Hold On” ft. Rick Ross38. Schoolboy Q “Man Of The Year”37. Earl Sweatshirt “Sunday” ft. Frank Ocean36. Jay Z “FuckwithmeyouknowIgotit” ft. Rick Ross35. Tyler, the Creator “IFHY” ft. Pharrell WilliamsThis is truly Tyler at his finest. From his beat to his bars, this track showcases Tyler’s supreme artistic talent. Oh, and there’s THAT VIDEO! The talk-rap, slow flow is personal and poetic. He combines crooning with curses effortlessly and elevates the track in doing so. The beat builds like a film. He even directed his idol Pharrell’s angelic voice on the bridge, with a melody Tyler created himself. Sonically this track was standout, and then he made that video and this became undeniably next-level. 34. Jay Z “Tom Ford”33. J Cole “Crooked Smile” ft. TLC32. Kendrick Lamar “Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe Remix” ft. Jay Z
31. Chance The Rapper “Acid Rain” 30. Childish Gambino “Telegraph Ave (Oakland)”Perhaps the universal favorite from the album, this is a dark, entrancing look at the compulsive and haunting power of our past loves/infatuations. Like The Boy driving down Telegraph Ave, we can spend our time retreading the same roads thinking about “what ifs” and reminiscing about things lost – sometimes alongside the people with whom we lost them. But unless we decide to do something about all those lost things – whether to try again, or to walk away for good – all that wandering isn’t going to do us any good. Using Lloyd’s “Oakland” literally in the song, Gambino cleverly plays both rapper and listener creating and experiencing the track with us.29. Tyler, the Creator “Rusty” ft. Domo Genesis & Earl Sweatshirt28. Chance The Rapper “Favorite Song” ft. Childish Gambino27. A$AP Ferg “Work (Remix)” ft. A$AP Rocky, French Montana, SchoolBoy Q & Trinidad James
26. Pusha T “King Push” 25. Chance The Rapper “Juice”The first single off Acid Rap, Juice was one of the big breakthroughs this year for Chance. The first thing that catches your ears is Chance’s sing-songy, cartoony flow which you can’t help singing along to (some jumping around is mandatory). But listen closely, and you get Chancelor’s dope bars: dense, great-sounding internal rhymes and clever Chicago references. As you’re headbanging through the verse though, you’re hit with that absolutely HYPE chorus that is guaranteed to make you lose your shit. What you’re left with is one of the catchiest, most memorable songs of 2013 and a high point in the spectacular year Chance has had.24. Drake “Hold On We're Going Home” ft. Majid Jordan23. A$AP Ferg “Shabba” ft. A$AP Rocky22. J Cole “Let Nas Down”21. Eminem “Berzerk""20. Drake “Worst Behavior”This Nothing Was The Same stand-out combines Drizzy’s loud, arrogant hook with even more flexin’ in his verses. DJ Dahi delivers with gritty, bass-heavy production deceptively containing no sample. Like many tracks on NWTS, Drake’s flow and the beat changes up across the song -- he even confidently borrows flow and bars from Ma$e’s “Mo Money Mo Problems” anthem. The music video stars his actual dad and uncles and contains his worst skit to date. Even with lyrics that playfully reference his famous Hot 97 freestyle blunder and remind us of his Degrassi roots, Drake manages to make one of the hardest bangers of 2013. Just accept that you’ll never get the timing right for that initial “.......WORST!”19. Earl Sweatshirt “Hive” ft. Vince Staples & Casey VeggiesThe leaps and bounds of growth that Earl Sweatshirt has experienced over the last several years can really be heard on Doris' standout track, “Hive.” Fueled by a bassline that gives the song that dark, Odd Future feel, Earl spits much more mature bars using his now polished signature flow. With the addition of a great hook from young Casey Veggies, the song was already fantastic. But then Vince Staples busts in with a ski mask and absolutely kills it. Did Vince renegade Earl? That's up for debate, but you can't deny that Shyne, and everyone else on the song, absolutely did their thing.18. Eminem “Love Game” ft. Kendrick LamarWhen the MMLP2 tracklist was revealed, Love Game was one of the most heavily-anticipated tracks; everyone was envisioning a Renegade-level back-and-forth between Em and Kendrick. But the song turned out to be as left-field as possible. Backed by a quirky Rick Rubin-produced instrumental that could’ve come straight from the ‘50s (cheesy sample included), Eminem describes his time with an unfaithful woman in hilarious detail, while Kendrick emulates Em’s flow and raps about his experiences with the infamous Sherane. Although a largely comical song, Love Game still has a lot of great rhymes, with an especially phenomenal third verse by Em. Despite their bad experiences with women, Marshall and K.Dot let us know that they’re always going to be playing the game of love!
17. Drake “Started From The Bottom”
“Started From The Bottom”, produced by Mike Zombie, was the first single off Drake's Nothing Was The Same album. The track was released in February and peaked at #6 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It has since been certified 2x Platinum. Some may doubt if Drake really did ‘start at the bottom’, but with 2.2 million pageviews on Rap Genius and one of the catchiest hooks of the year, there is no doubt that this track was one of the biggest anthems of 2013.16. Childish Gambino “3005”The lead single for Because the Internet is quintessential Childish Gambino, but is also a great showcase for the artist’s development over the last two years. It’s a good sampling of the album’s overall sound and texture. Gambino paints a great picture of how, if you don’t have someone you really care about beside you, you can be completely alone in a crowded room, to say nothing of dealing with the rest of the shit life throws at you. He both raps and sings exceptionally well and effortlessly here. Gambino also gave us a pleasantly metaphorical video to accompany the song and make us think even more.
15. Chance The Rapper “Cocoa Butter Kisses” ft. Vic Mensa & TwistaTwo generations of Chicago hip-hop converge on this mixtape cut, with one artist already garnering national attention introducing another to the scene and re-introducing an OG from his city. Vic steals the show with an urgent and unforgiving verse, and Chance happily cedes the spotlight to him, restraining himself to an unassumingly spry and sing-songy verse; Twista, on the other hand, is not quite so willing to take a back seat, successfuly lacing the track with his trademark double-time bars. But amidst the aggressively fast raps of the trio, the hook has a contrastingly soothing melody that rounds out the entire production. This track firmly announces that hip-hop is once again Chicagoan.
14. Jay Z “Holy Grail” ft. Justin TimberlakeIn a year of nervy choices that made business headlines around the world, Jay Z's boldest decision was actually a musical one. The only voice you hear during the first 1:19 of his new album's leadoff track is not Hov, but rather Justin Timberlake. This only manages to build anticipation, so that we are well-primed for the rapper's entry.And what an entry it is. His daughter's name is literally the first word out of his mouth, and with good reason. A post-fatherhood Jay is contemplative about the ups and downs of a personified fame, while admitting ultimately that he can't leave it alone. And lest we think he's lost a step, his patented wordplay is in full effect, with a pun on ""pigeons"" that puts today's coke-rappers to shame.13. ASAP Rocky “1 Train” ft. Kendrick Lamar, Joey Badass, Yelawolf, Danny Brown, Action Bronson and Big K.R.I.T.
""1 Train"" is the cypher to end all cyphers. A$AP Rocky amalgamated a line-up without a single weak spitter, and they all did their worst to this Hit-Boy produced banger. It's impossible to pick who delivered the best verse here: was it the energized Danny Brown? the lovable braggart Action Bronson? the wordsmith Joey Bad? the hard-driving Big K.R.I.T.? Someone else? I can't decide, but I do know this: the track is flames
12. Schoolboy Q “Collard Greens” Kendrick LamarA cut between two of Top Dawg Entertainment's main artists, Schoolboy Q and Kendrick Lamar came in to make a party banger just in time for summer. Schoolboy Q delivers a solid verse about his favorite things, (and how other people can't have them), before Kendrick comes in with that Español that makes this verse so memorable. The hook might be a little random, but the vibe it generates makes it infectious upon first listen.11. Kanye West “ Black Skinhead”When word dropped that Daft Punk would be working with Kanye West on his new album, it was fair to assume it would result in a genre-blending song like Stronger. What we ended up with was indeed a blend of genres, but instead of electronic synths and filtered vocals, we got primal screams and distorted 808’s. Kanye is pissed off, but not the kind of pissed he gets about croissants or Jimmy Kimmel. No, Ye is fed up with people questioning his choices and he’s frustrated that nobody is taking risks anymore. And it’s palpable in this song, which represents the rebellious, IDGAF attitude that flows from both Kanye and Yeezus. Using few else but drums and vocal sounds you’d more likely hear exploring the Amazon than in Hip Hop, Kanye crafts an uneasy, raw instrumental that pairs perfectly with his blunt lyrics10. J Cole “Power Trip” ft. MiguelIn classic J. Cole fashion, nearly everything on this track is done by himself. The smooth voice of Miguel helps out on a hook, but otherwise it is Cole’s world. The incredibly catchy hooks match up perfectly with his production and he drops plenty of relatable bars about a crush. This continuation of his 2009 song “Dreams” is about not only a girl, but also hip-hop and its impact on him - giving an already impressive song some duality. And much like the song sounds, its video felt like a short film as Cole literally does whatever it takes to claim his love. The 10th most viewed song on RG in 2013, fans spent a combined 7.5 years of time on this song page!09. Drake “Pound Cake/Paris Morton Music 2” ft. Jay ZDrake crafts one of the most memorable tracks of 2013 with the outro to his third studio LP Nothing Was The Same. Boi-1da delivers on Pound Cake with a spacey Ellie Goulding sample as Drizzy paints the picture about what his life has been like while recording and making the album.The song isn’t finished there by any means. After two Jay verses, Drake comes back in for Paris Morton Music 2 and a perfect verse to remind us this is his song. The extra long PMM 2 verse is also very personal, looking back on the landscape of  his career and perhaps how he’s no longer the same
08. Pusha T “Numbers On The Boards”
My Name Is My Name is a stark minimalist creation and with the “No Artwork” cover, “Numbers On The Boards” is the centerpiece. Don Cannon & Kanye West create the spine with King Push on his super Lupe raps in between catchy samples. Push said all year he wanted to bring “that feeling back”, and “Numbers On The Boards” knocks harder than him thumping the wall with his fist. The lyrically enthralling track is jam packed with references and double entendres that takes you to Pusha’s dark underground hell in only a way he could.07. “Kanye West - Bound 2” ft. Charlie Wilson
“Bound 2” was an unexpected but wholly welcome ending to Yeezus. The song has sparked wide discussion: is it a rejection of the past 37 minutes? Is it a reassurance to fans about Kanye’s present musical identity? Is it a revelation about Kanye’s future? Who really cares? Kanye fans who hated Yeezus loved it and Kanye fans who loved Yeezus loved it. “Bound 2” is a weirdly endearing love song featuring classic Kanye flow floating over soul samples, topped with Charlie Wilson’s magical voice. What’s not to like?! Well, many would actually say “the video”, which was an overtly cheesy, green-screened, steamy motorcycle ride that not only made the world cringe, but also felt like the furthest thing from Ye’s aesthetic. But that was the point. Ye geniusly defied our expectations and used his prettiest song’s video as a commentary on the “wack” quality of American art and media that he feels should be banned. How very, New Slaves of him.06. Eminem “Bad Guy”Sequels to much-loved properties are rarely a good idea. For every The Empire Strikes Back, there are three Matrix Reloadeds.  So when word leaked out that Em had recorded a follow-up to his epic 2000 story-song “Stan,” fans were nervous.  After all, Stan died at the end, right? So what’s left?Plenty, as it turns out.  Marshall turned a potentially bad idea into fantastic art with his imagining of Stan’s little brother Matthew (with the autographed Starter cap), now all grown up and seeking revenge.  But just as the tale reaches its apex, the song switches perspective, revealing an intense look at Eminem’s self-doubts and anguish. Just before the end, he drops the biggest gem of all: his in-song tormentors are “just symbolic/Of not knowing what you had ‘til it’s gone.”  The rapper himself may not know, but trust us, Slim, we do.05. Pusha T “Nosetalgia” ft. Kendrick LamarThis genre defining song starts with a dirty Nottz beat that makes you feel like committing a crime and quickly escalates to the feeling you’re part of one. The KRS sample serves as the hook and sounds of scratches fill the airwaves. Kings Push & Kendrick come through with menacing delivery and complex wordplay. While Terrence is neck deep in dealing, Kendrick is in the midst of consumption - the contrast is phenomenal, both MC’s affected by the crack epidemic in opposing instances. The insight into Kendrick’s story is rare, the Compton native always let us ride around his house but never let us through the front door. “Nosetalgia” is your 8ball on a Friday night, 4 shots of espresso every morning, and the In N Out double double you crave in LA. It’s dope. 04. Kanye West “Blood On The Leaves”
Blood On The Leaves introduces a new piece into the emotional puzzle of Yeezus: remorse. The song is drowning in so many feels, it’s impossible not to catch some yourself. Kanye’s autotuned story of sadness begins atop the somber piano of the beautifully chopped Strange Fruit sample, but then the blaring horns and bass of TNGHT’s R U Ready burst through and all of a sudden that sadness turns to rage. By the end of it all you’re left with a modern day power ballad with enough autotune and raw emotion to make Future blush. Blood On The Leaves got to a bit of a slow start on Rap Genius due to lack of exposure pre-album release, but thanks in part to Kanye’s emotionally charged VMA performance the song is one of the most viewed Yeezus tracks on the site. The song’s instrumental has also become one of Producer Genius’ prized breakdowns, explaining the use of the song’s controversial Nina Simone sample and the origin of that beat drop. Can you imagine if Yeezus started off with this song, like Kanye originally planned? The world would have imploded.03. Eminem “Rap God”
”Six minutes, Slim Shady, you’re on”. After the novelty of a second Marshall Mathers LP began to wear off, Eminem got the buzz back by becoming the third MC this year to proclaim himself a god. This rapid-fire lyrical tour de force is laced with references to the first Mathers LP, sneak disses to some of his old buddies, and a 17 second stretch crammed with over 100 words. The Detroit native also broke Rap Genius the day ""Rap God"" was released, and has now amassed over 4 million page views
Proving himself in the booth was just the beginning for Slim. After criticism he lip synced on live television, Marshall Mathers showed up to the YouTube music awards and destroyed the hopes and dreams of every rapper alive when he performed the song live. It’s safe to say ""Rap God"" proved the internal rhyme mastermind is back on his Pharoahe Monch grind and nothing’s going to stop him.02. Big Sean “Control” ft. Kendrick Lamar & Jay ElectronicaYou all knew this was coming. Big Sean delivered a 3 minute dope verse to open the track. Comparing his rapping skill to a baby's first steps and reminiscing on his grandfather, he manages to give one of the best verses of his career. For obvious reasons, we'll skip to Jay Electronica next. He too spit a clean verse about religion, while sneaking in TV and car references, and even mentioning his late grandmother, much like Sean did.
However, there was a 3rd feature to this monster track produced by No I.D. His name? King Kendrick Lamar. He came with one purpose: to assassinate the competition. The lyrical warfare was on for all to see and was full of levels. The Compton MC proclaimed he was both 2Pac's offspring and the King of New York, causing mass hysteria in hip hop’s homeland. But oh no, it wasn’t over yet. His braggadocio left mouths agape as he goes on to say he is as popular as the Beatles and placed his name up for one of the greatest MC's of all time. And yet there was more...he called out every hot young rapper - by their name, a rarity in Hip Hop (no sneak disses here!). Basically Kendrick manages to piss off every rapper and revolutionize the rap game at the same damn time. How about it?
01. Kanye West “New Slaves” ft. Frank Ocean
""New Slaves"" is best described as an “open letter” from Kanye West to the people - made into music. Produced by the Very G.O.O.D Beats crew, New Slaves is sonically simplistic yet still possesses melody courtesy of the droning synths. Frank Ocean assists on the outro, providing an amazing contrast to the aggressive tone used throughout the song, acting in a reflective manner. However from a lyrical standpoint it’s without a doubt one of Kanye’s greatest songs. He labeled verse 2 as the “best verse of all time” and with topics that range from modern day slavery to the fashion industry, and even America's prison system, it’s hard to disagree
The Chi-town native doesn’t just stop at the music. With a guerrilla marketing scheme fit for a military coup, Ye projected the track onto buildings in 66 locations across the world. It’s been 8 months since the song’s release and the significance of ”New Slaves is only just surfacing. Between the time of the song’s release and present day, the attitude of multiple industries has started to shift dramatically - would Jay Z and Beyonce have released projects with such unorthodox promotion methods if Kanye didn’t do it first? His movement, spearheaded with this peoples anthem, was made to inspire others to think in a similar light. ”New Slaves” invokes the power of free speech and brandishing the truth like an axe, Kanye challenges listeners to think outside the Matrix
Just as Mandela blew up the buildings and eventually became president. Contrary to popular opinion, sometimes you have to blow up the building.— Kanye West"

I wanna just live
Inside my Cadillac
That is my shit
Now throw it up (I throw that up)
That’s what it is (that’s what it is)
In my C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C, bitch (biatch)

Can’t see me through my tints (nah ah)
I’m riding real slow (slow motion)
In my paint, wet, dripping, shining like my 24s (umbrella)
I ain’t got 24s (nuh-uh)
But I’m on those Vogues
That’s those big white walls, round them hundred spokes
Old school like Olde English in that brown paper bag
I’m rolling in that same whip that my granddad had
Hello haters, damn y’all mad
30K on the Caddy, now how backpack rap is that?

I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

Man, I’m lounging
In some shit Bernie Mac would’ve been proud of
Looking down from heaven like damn that’s stylish
Smilin’, don’t pay attention to the mileage
Can I hit the freeway? Illegally going 120
Easy weaving in and out of the traffic
They cannot catch me, I’m smashing
I’m ducking, bucking them out here
I’m looking fucking fantastic, I am up in a classic
Now I know what it’s like under the city lights
Riding into the night, driving over the bridge
The same one we walked across as kids
Knew I’d have a whip but never one like this
Old school, old school, candy paint, two seater
Yea, I’m from Seattle, there’s hella Honda Civics
I couldn’t tell you about paint either
But I really wanted a Caddy so I put in the hours
And roll on over to the dealer
And I found the car I dreamed of, placed a bargain with this geezer
Got the keys in as I was leaving I started screaming

I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

Backwoods and dope
White hoes in the backseat snortin' coke
She doing line after line like she's writing rhymes
I had her inhalin' my love, tryna blow her mind
Cadillac pimpin', my uncle was on
14, I stole his keys, me and my niggas was gone
Stealing portions of his liquor, water in his Patron
Driving smiling like I won the fucking lottery homes
(Fuckin' lottery homes)
Tires with the spokes on it, and the Vogues too
Mustard and mayonnaise, keepin' the buns all on
My dogs hanging out the window
Young as whoosh, fucking like we ball
Tryna fuck 'em all
Never park the whip, see what's poppin' at the mall
Meet a bad bitch, slap her booty with my paw
You can smoke the pussy, I was tearing down the walls
I'm motherfuckin' awe-
-some, swear these sights tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steering wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes
Maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Or does she want it low?
'Cause this shit a Coupe de Ville so you’ll never know
So we cruise for minutes, my nigga fuck the limit
Got a window tinted, for sure a gangsta in it
Slide 'til the gas is finished
Q

Off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright
Got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so, looked so bright"

Hello!
Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe?
Le sexe, je veux dire: l'activité physique, le coït. Tu aimes ça?
Tu ne t'intéresses pas au sexe?
Les hommes pensent que les féministes détestent le sexe mais c'est une activité très stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent

Take all of me

Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like, ""Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest""
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me
He was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man, I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga


Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit, yeah

The other night
Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up"

Rolled down a window, where you headed to next?

Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how

People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am

So honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how

People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

That, baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

So baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are"

We were victims of the night
A chemical, physical, kryptonite
Helpless to the bass and fading light
Oh, we were bound to get together
Bound to get together

She took my arm, I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said

She said, “Shut up and dance with me”
This woman is my destiny
She said, “Oooooh, shut up and dance with me”

A backless dress and some beat up sneaks
My discotheque Juliet, teenage dream
I felt it in my chest since she looked at me
I knew we were bound to be together
Bound to be together

She took my arm, I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said

Deep in her eyes, I think I see the future
I realize this is my last chance

Saw you there, and I thought
""Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?""
Ayy

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessin' like
""Oh my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

Roll it with me and then light that up and the rest is history write that, book
My cheerleader, something about her demeanor
Even though I'm off these margaritas can't none of these hoes here come between us
Shorty no regular chick, so I just take her to places she ain't know exist
So she never forget, who the man is
She gives me love and affection
Baby did I mention, you're the only girl for me
No I don't need a next one
Mama loves you too, she thinks I made the right selection
Now all that's left to do

She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshiped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
""We were born sick""
You heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only Heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

Amen, Amen, Amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean

Oh, oh Amen, Amen, Amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church

But I can make an explosion

And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?

This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now, I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care
If nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got
A lot of fight left in me

Losing friends and I'm chasing sleep
Everybody's worried about me
In too deep, say I'm in too deep (In too deep)
And it's been two years, I miss my home
But there's a fire burning in my bones
Still believe
Yeah, I still believe

And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?

This is my fight song

Pull up to the club and it go up
Make your girl fall in love when I show up
It's not my fault she want to know me
She told me you was just a homie
She came down like she knew me
Gave it up like a groupie
And that's facts, no printer
Cold boy turn the summer to the winter
She save me in her phone as bestie
But I had her screaming oooh
Yo girl wasn't supposed to text me
You want to know how I know what I know
Chorus

Got these girls in my section, finna blow up
Alan Z got them wet when I roll up
You can see it in their eyes and lips, their thighs and hips

Team us we ain't worried about you
Murder she wrote

Murder she wrote
You want to know how I know what I know

I'm a magnet to anybody with ovaries
If she go toe to toe with me, she gon' see I'm a total freak
Totally, young dirty bastard reminiscent of ODB
Eat it like groceries, could give it to Jhene Aiko with ease
Like I’m 'post to be
Got fans making social media posts of me
Buzzing more than locally, from Atlanta to overseas
If you wanna roll with me, just Say Yes like Floetry
Get you off tonight, on and off the mic, banging over beats
DJ Xross:
Banging over beats, spitting rhymes and poetry
Senpai notice me, and she be all like OMG
Ya girl all over me, I check her out like groceries
Her assets now my property cuz she won't let go of me

For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

You've been so unavailable
Now, sadly, I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realise my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
You say I'm crazy

Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city…"

But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing to take with us when we die

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me, that's okay baby
Only words bleed inside these pages
You just hold me
And I won’t ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me, that's okay baby
Only words bleed inside these pages
You just hold me
And I won’t ever let you go

When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home"

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you, I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you, I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you, I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you, I'm sorry for breaking your heart

Look like Mariah, I took another shot
Told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot
Dirty talk, dirty dance
She a freaky girl and I'm a freaky man
She on the rebound, broke up with her ex
And I'm like Rodman, ready on deck
I told her, ""Wanna ride out?"", and she said yes
We didn't go to church, but I got blessed

And you're not looking for anything right now

Don't get me wrong
Your eyes are so intimidating
My heart is pounding but
It's just a conversation
No girl, I'm not wasted
You don't know me
I don't know you but I want to

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just want to take your time
I don't wanna wreck your Friday
I ain't gonna waste my lines
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

And I know it starts with hello
And the next thing you know you're try to be nice
And some guys getting too close
Trying to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk
And I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
Cause she's supposed to save you from random guys
That talk too much and wanna stay too long
It's the same old song and dance but I think you know it well
You could've rolled your eyes
Told me to go to hell
Could've walked away
But you're still here
And I'm still here
Come on let's see where it goes

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't have to meet your mother
We don't have to cross that line
I don't wanna steal your covers
I just wanna take your time

I don't wanna go home with you
I just wanna be alone with you

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't wanna blow your phone up
I just wanna blow your mind

I see you callin', I be makin' it quick
I'ma answer that shit like, ""I don't fuck with you.""
Bitch, I got no feelings to go
I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go
I mean, for real, fuck how you feel
Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill
Yeah, and every day I wake up celebratin' shit
Why? ‘Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch
I stuck to my guns, that's what made me rich
That's what put me on, that's what got me here
That's what made me this
And everything that I do is my first name (B-I-G)
These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain
Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me
I just bought a crib, three stories; that bitch a trilogy
And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone
I got a bitch that text me she ain't got no clothes on
And then another one text, then your ass next
And I'ma text your ass back, like…

I don't fuck with you

Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

Got a million things on my mind, executive deals online
Limited amount of time, chasin' these dollar signs
And you ain't on your grind
You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I could've put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten
My niggas put murder missions
She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich
Got a blunt in my dental, blowin' hemp in a rental
On my way to Sacramento, late night; Arsenio
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever, like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my styrofoam up, and pour some drink in my mouth
Why you always coming around with bad news?
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose
Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew
But them niggas cool, it's just that…

Bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you (Lil biatch!)

Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for
I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for
Yeah, I got a lot but want a lot more
Yeah, we in the buildin', but I'm tryna take it to the top floor
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up
It seem like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator
Yeah, I know that karma's too real
So I hope you doin' cool, but still…

Stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
Little stupid ass… I ain't fuckin with…
I ain't fuckin'… I ain't, I ain't fuckin' with you
I ain't fuckin' with you (Straight up)"

Yeah, that was a setup, for a punchline on duct tape
Worried 'bout if my butt's fake, worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
These girls are my sons, John & Kate Plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5 is my idea of an update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fuck with them real niggas, who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is, ring finger where the rock is
These hoes couldn't test me, even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with, mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in, like seasonin'
And tell 'em bitches blow me, Lance Stephenson

Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

I never fucked Nicki, cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought god damn, this is the perfect time
We had just come from that video
You know LA traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt
But I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, lowkey it may be high key
I been peeped that you like me, you know
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn’t take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I’m obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that’s right, I like my girls BBW, yeah
Type to wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh, yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad-ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you
Oh, that’s cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck, just give me the heads-up
So I can plan for it
(Pinkprint, AYE!)

Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

I never fucked Nick and that's fucked up
If I did fuck she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin', ain't hittin' it right
Cause she actin' like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story teller
I piss greatness like gold is yellow
All my goons, so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calender say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up, if she wave
They bet not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? I take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' bout runnin' in houses, with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, messed up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy my nigga, I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the B out, behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off I blow your face off
I mean pop-pop-pop then I take off
Nigga now you see me, nigga now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles
16 in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with 17 bullets
My story is how I went from ""poor me""
To ""please pour me a drink and celebrate with me""

Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only"

What the heart wants (Wants, wants, wants)

You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing I've ever known
I'm hoping that after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings, no wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

The heart wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants

Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm about is talkin' blunt and staying blunted

We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?

Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things

And I ain't talkin' about that Lil Wayne record
I'm still the highest sellin' female rapper, for the record
Man, this a 65 million single sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll

You a stand-up or is you in your chair right now?

Pretty ladies, are you here?
Truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low
You ain't gotta tell your friend
That I eat it in the morning
Cause she gonna say ""I know""
Can I hit it in the bathroom?
Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put one leg on the tub
Girl, this my new dance move
I just don't know what to call it
But bitch you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude
What's his name? — Not important
I brought some cocaine if you snortin'
She became a vacuum
Put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off white chocolate

That one day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy

You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side

Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey

Squad goin' up
Nobody flippin' packs now
I just did three in a row
Them shows is back-to-back to back now
Put the world on our sound
You know PARTY and The Weeknd
Ain't got no motherfuckin' time
To party on the weekend
Tell Gelo bring the juice
We about to get lit
Fill the room up with some tings
One night off and this is it
Always workin' OT
Overtime and out of town
Shit is crazy back home
It kills me that I'm not around
I think we gettin' too deep
Shit I'm talkin' might be too true
Upstairs I got Xans in an Advil bottle
I don't take them shits but you do
So I got 'em for you
I don't need the pills
I'm just gon' have another drink
And when I'm puttin' work in on a weekend
I'll look back on this and think
How we had the club going up

Goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey

Workin' Monday night
On the corner flippin' hard
Made at least three thousand
On the boulevard
I've been workin' graveyard
Shifts every other weekend
Ain't got no fuckin' time
To party on the weekend
I've been flippin' in the house
Makin' juggs on the highway
I've been ridin' out of state
Makin' money like my way
I don't think that I should dance
I'm just gon' have another drink
I'm doin' my stance
You know my molly pink
I got the loudest of the loud
You know my gas stink
My P.O. think I'm in the house
Don't give a damn 'bout what she think

Got the club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey

It ain't no way, no how
I made it on my own
I made my own style
I don't think that I should stay
You know I gotta go
Been moving too fast
Don't wanna take it slow

Got the club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday

No FaceTime but the people want to Skype me
If I do time then who would really write me

Clean pair of sneaks, with a designer belt
Please watch your step cause I'm feeling myself

We are both thots so we are both are crazy
Flexing always on my agenda
Your whole team rats, your CEO is Master Splinter
Bout to hit the Quan and turn that girl into a member
Now my whole team flexing, I think we got a winner
People want to dap it up but they can't get none from me
I went to jail and snap it up, at least I had bum money
People wanna walk around me tryna steal my lingo
Just make sure when you talk about me you say he's doing his thing though

Hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan
I said get down low and swing your arm
I said get down low and hit the Quan
I'm finna show you how to
Hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan

You don't want to come out, but you don't want to be alone
It don't take but two to have a little soiree
If you're in the mood, sit tight right where you are, babe

'Cause I'll be at your door in ten minutes
Whatever you got on, girl, stay in it
You ain't gotta leave the house to have a good time
I'ma bring the good time home to you

We'll have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boombox out
We'll wake up all the neighbors til the whole block hates us
And the cops show up and try to shut us down

If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party

Throw a neon t-shirt over the lamp shade
I'll take the furniture, slide it out of the way
Shaking the floor, rattling the roof
We'll go to town right there in your living room

Let's have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boombox out
We'll wake up all the neighbors til the whole block hates us
And the cops will show up and try to shut us down

If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party

So I'll be at your door in ten minutes
Whatever you got on, baby, stay in it
You ain't gotta leave the house to have a good time
I'ma bring the good time home to you

We'll have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boombox out
We'll wake up all the neighbors til the whole block hates us
And the cops will show up and try to shut us down

If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody

Tractors, plows with flashing lights
Backin’ up a two lane road
They take one last lap around
That sun up high goes down
And then it's on, come on
Girl kick it on back
Z71 like a Cadillac

We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let’s tear it up, up
And kick the dust up (kick the dust up...)

Bar downtown they got a line
Of people way out the door
$10 dollar drinks, it’s packed inside
I don’t know what they’re waitin for
Got me a jar full of clear
And I got that music for your ears
And it’s like knock, knock, knock goes the diesel
If you really wanna see the beautiful people

We go way out where
There ain’t nobody

We broke down everything Kanye West has said in 2015 to provide a more insightful view on the most polarizing man in pop culture.
January 1: Kanye West ft. Paul McCartney - ""Only One""
Kanye delivered ""Only One"" from the perspective of his late mother, Donda West, as she looks on him from Heaven. He couldn't remember singing the song when lines were played back to him, and concluded Donda was sending him a message.  The song is very similar to The Beatles' ""Let It Be"", which Sir Paul McCartney wrote about the death of his mother.
Legendary producer Rick Rubin  annotated the song's first verse:
Kanye is a combination of careful and spontaneous. He’ll find a theme he likes quickly, and then live with that for a while, not necessarily filling in all the words until later. At the end, he’ll fill in all the gaps
He was upset at one point when I said that he wrote the lyrics quickly. He’s right — they percolate for a long time, he gets the phrasing into his brain, lives with it, and then lines come up. It definitely starts from this very spontaneous thing
On Only One, a lot of those lyrics came out free-form, ad-libs. The song is essentially live, written in the moment. Some of the words were later improved, but most of it was stream of consciousness, just Kanye being in the momentJanuary 25: Rihanna ft. Kanye West & Paul McCartney - ""FourFiveSeconds""
Yeezy's return to the charts couldn't have come with a better tune. The stripped back 70's esque track features a booming chorus from Rihanna, accompanied by Sir Paul McCartney's chord progression on the acoustic guitar. The genre blending song is the brainchild of West & McCartney, who originally created the song for Kanye's So Help Me God.
If I go to jail tonight
Promise you'll pay my bail
See they want to buy my pride
But that just ain't up for sale
January 27: Ellen Degeneres Show
Kanye has appeared on the Ellen Show four times in his career - 2008, 2010, 2013, and now 2015. Like his previous visit, he used the opportunity to premiere a music video - this time for ""Only One"". He also spoke about his change in attitude since Yeezus, his marriage, and clothing line with Adidas.
Ellen: How do you think marriage has changed you, if it has?
Kanye: I've definitely learned how to compromise more. Which is something you have to understand when you partner with people in business.January 29: Big Sean ft. Drake & Kanye West - ""Blessings""
Big Sean's  ""Blessings"" featuring Drake and Kanye (on the remix) gave each artist a chance to give thanks for the lives they lead. Of course Kanye didn't stop there, he gave us a hint at what he might be planning in the future.
And my daughter right there getting home-schooled
I'm blessed/And I was thinking 'bout starting up my own school/A MontessoriJanuary 31: The Daily’s Fashion Los Angeles Awards Speech
Kanye's relationship with the fashion industry is similar to his relationship with music: he started at the bottom, now he's here. While he may be ridiculed by the outside world, he's well regarded by some of the industries most respected members - Mazdack Rassi and Anna Wintour are among them.
As we all know, The Devil Wears Prada was about Anna..I said, “I wanna be in the middle of that conversation.”...She was talking about the blue sweater...Let’s make the conversation shorter between when the blue sweater goes from a Wang show to when it finally hit Kohl’s’ or something.February  9: E.T interviews Kanye pre Grammys
""This is the irony of my life"" - Kanye discussed his plans to improve the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences with E.T pre Grammys - none of those plans included getting up on stage.
I'm appreciative of my nomination but I really just wanted to use the stage to perform this song ""Only One"". It's extremely important to me. Also the Grammy's could adjust their voting system, I think it's extremely flawed but we're going to work on that, I'm not going to complain from stage about it. I'm gonna work on it from the inside
February 9: E! interviews Kanye post Grammys
In the space of five hours Kanye had changed his mind, gracing the stage at the Grammys to protest Beck's ""Album Of The Year"" win over Beyonce. While everyone thought Kanye was poking fun at himself, Yeezus  turned up to the after party and had some choice words - none of which came out in the right order.
We ain't finna play with them no more. ""***Flawless"", Beyoncé video. And Beck needs to respect artistry, and he should've given his award to Beyoncé.February 11: On Air with Ryan Seacrest
Kanye called Ryan Seacrest to set the record straight two days after the most tweeted about moment at the Grammys. While not apologising directly to Beck (he did this on The Breakfast Club), Kanye clarified what he mean't by ""respect artistry"".
When I said that thing about respect artistry, I think it came off the wrong way, and that was a mis-wording on my part because obviously Beck is one of the most respected artists and respects artistry. But I felt — and this is my opinion and he’s his own man and he’s not wrong and we’ll still go play basketball and stuff  he doesn’t want to do it — but I felt that even though the Grammys some times gives awards to people who you wouldn’t think should win in the category, as a respect to artists, we mention the other artist’s name in our speech. And that was the point I was making about it. There’s like many of times I gave other people my award, literally made them come up onstage. Maroon 5, when they won best new artist,  mentioned me because it was the College Dropout and  10 nominations and all that.February  12: André Leon Talley interviews Kanye for Vogue
After showcasing YEEZY SEASON 1 during New York Fashion Week, Kanye was asked how he feels about his ""pronouncements that become viral, and go viral immediately"" -  in reference to the Beck incident - his answer:
I feel good, I feel like a human being, I feel like a man. A man can make mistakes, a man can have an opinion, a man can be hypocritical. But you know, I feel like I have blood in my veins. That my blood hasn't been turned cold by the concept of celebrity or missed opportunities or perception.February  12: Kanye West discusses his new fashion line with MTV
Mr. West spoke to MTV after YEEZY SEASON 1 about ""taste levels"" and  challenging critics & viewers to share his vision of the future.
Taste shouldn't be used to separate, it should be used to problem solve. So I've been raising my taste level and educating myself and putting myself around people with way higher taste. And now we're using it to give something back to the people and this is the very beginning. Mark this interview, mark this interview, look back at this interview five years from now and see what happens from this. For anyone, you know who reviews the collection poorly, whatever they might do - not even to put that type of energy out there, but if they do, I really feel sorry for that they don't have a vision of what the future holds - cause you just saw the future.
February  12: Kanye West ft. SIa & Vic Mensa - ""Wolves""
Kanye debuted ""Wolves"" at the YEEZY SEASON 1 launch event during New York Fashion Week and live broadcasts in fifty movie theatres across the globe. ""Wolves""  explores a range of emotions - depression, addiction, suicide, fear, hope and love. Kanye, Vic Mensa & Sia had to reach their lowest of lows to get where they are today.
Lost out, beat up
Dancin', down there
I found you, somewhere out
'Round 'round there, right right there
Lost and beat up
Down there, dancin'
I found you, somewhere out
Right down there, right 'round thereFebruary  16: The Kanye West Interview with Style.com
Style.com provided one of Kanye's most articulate interviews since his media hiatus ended in 2013.  He opened up about his feelings on the Adidas line, his perception in the fashion world, and how he ascended from spoofed designer to fashion god.
Just as much as Drake is influenced by Kanye West, you know my fucking influences. You see Raf Simons right there, you see Helmut, you see Margiela, you see Vanessa , you see Katharine Hamnett. It’s blatantly right there.February  16: Complex Magazine Interviews Kanye West
Kanye also spoke to Complex Magazine during NYFW, comparing  the Adidas collection to the Superbowl and himself to illusionist David Blaine. However, what surprised us most was this on-point comparison with Eminem.
I feel like I’m Eminem, you know? You don’t think ""white rapper."" You just think Eminem. You don’t think celebrity designer, straight designer, black designer, all these types of things that kind of held me back conceptually in being accepted as a designer. You just think of those words. But when those moon boots come out, you put them on your feet and just swag out and go somewhere with your friends, those words don't matter. February  17: Big Sean ft. Kanye West & John Legend - ""One Man Can Change The World""
Kanye continued to jump on Big Sean's singles and on February 17, the pair, along with John Legend released the moving ""One Man Can Change The World"" - an ode to their mothers and grandmothers.
And when you get it all just remember one thing
Remember one thing
That one man could change the world
That one man could change the world
February 21: The Breakfast Club Interview
After a vintage interview in 2013, the Charlemagne vs Kanye war was ready to heat up again in 2015. While everyone was expecting a difference of opinion, the two old rivals surprisingly got along. Kanye spoke candidly about doing more for the artists he's signed, as well as what he can do for hip hop.
But I owe hip-hop. You know, just like, saying like, Ben Horowitz is the only VC out in San Fran that believes in rap. You know, he gave Nas a piece of Rap Genius and all that. You know, he used to be in a rap group. But, you know we all owe hip-hop.
February 24: Big Sean ft. Kanye West - ""All Your Fault""
Rumoured to have originally been Kanye's song, ""All Your Fault"" features Big Sean & Ye trading bars over a rich Ambrosia’ sample. While he admitted to during The Breakfast Club Interview his father Ray advised he stay out of 2014's heated debate on race in America, he went ahead regardless.
But cops chokin' niggas out in the media
We finna have to protest and tear the city up
We bout to tear this whole place up pretty muchFebruary  24: BET Honors Speech
Ever since Kanye West's had a platform to express himself, he's educated us about the future. They told him he wasn't going to rap - he rapped. They told him he wasn't going to make clothes - he does that too. Parts of his BET Honors Speech drew us back to his College Dropout days, and reminded us at the end of the day he's still the same old Kanye.
So don't think that because we can afford this custom Balmain suit that we're free. And don't think that because we can buy a $300,000 car that we're free. February 26: Kanye West ft Allan Kingdom, Paul McCartney & Theophilus London T - ""All Day""
After the release of pop tracks ""Only One"" & ""FourFiveSeconds"", Kanye dropped a banger at the BRIT Awards. The performance was as grandiose as the production, with flamethrowers and what Theophilus London described as ""goons"" on stage. Kanye did what he does best - get people talking.
Don't really matter what I make, boy, you know I still go wild. Like a light skinned slave, boy, we in the mothafuckin' houseFebruary  27th: Interview with Zane Lowe on BBC Radio 1
Kanye's 2013 interview with Zane Lowe is widely regarded as his most polarizing. Yet in 2015 we saw a new Kanye. He went from calling himself ""a god"" in 2013, to referring to himself as the ""40 year old virgin of dealing with corporations"" just 18 months later. He also went onto describe his new album, titled So Help Me God.
Kanye West: I mean, it's a joyful noise onto the Lord. Like, it is still, you know, the struggle, you know, but the beauty from the struggle. You know
Zane Lowe: As opposed to just the struggle?
Kanye West: Yea, the song Amazing Grace, you know coming out of the worst pain possible and making the most beautiful song you know, possible.
March 3: Lecture at Oxford University
No stranger to prestigious universities (see his speech at Harvard School of Design in 2013), Kanye lectured at Oxford University's Guild Society, providing students with his view on  social constructs, including racism and classism.
You could say ""But you are successful?"" I’m successful in learning about the beauty that is afforded to rich people. But in learning that, being brought up, middle class, it’s something that is beating out of my chest. ‘Wait a second, I was middle class, and I didn’t get to see none of this shit!’March 4: Unreleased: Behind The Scenes With GQ
Kanye graced the cover of GQ magazine for the summer of 2014, but it wasn't until March 2015 that the behind the scenes video of the photo shoot surfaced online. The relatively short interview features Kanye discussing tones and proportions, along with ""taking things to the Genius level"".
If you're given a voice, you have to take that seriously. March 8: Interview with WWD Paris
After producing the majority of his previous album in a Paris loft, Kanye's love of everything French continued into 2015 with a four night residency at the Louis Vuitton Foundation. During his visit to Paris Fashion Week, he spoke to Womens Wear Daily and described his love of the city, and why his experience in Paris has made him a better creative.
As a musician, I would have never been able to design a show like what you saw tonight if it hadn’t been for my experience in Paris — learning how to minimize and make design decisions, how we started with just the single light.
March 12: Interview with CliqueTV
Kanye caught up with Clique TV and old friend Jean Touitou for an interview at the A.P.C Headquarters in Paris. He discussed race, designing, and the struggles of fame.
The thought was that everything popular was very basic and not complex and the negative connotation of commercial. So soon as you're commercial, you don't have the complexity of a Bach, a Mozart, a Basquiat, and if you say out loud as a commercial person that you're in the same breath as Basquiat, then everyone looks at you like you're an egomaniac or somethingApril 10: Vic Mensa ft. Kanye West ""U Mad""
The Kanye West drought hadn't even lasted a month when Vic Mensa dropped ""U Mad"" off his Street Lights EP. Kanye's verse was littered with quotables, notably his reference to multiple ""MJ's"".
I feel like MJ, I'm in his shoes
I'm talkin' Montell Jordan, this is how we doApril 10: Profile by T Magazine
The New York Times profiled West during New York Fashion week, touching on his previous frustrations with the fashion industry, working with Adidas, and his own psyche.
I have this table in my new house, they put this table in without asking. It was some weird nouveau riche marble table, and I hated it. But it was literally so heavy that it took a crane to move it. We would try to set up different things around it, but it never really worked
I realized that table was my ego. No matter what you put around it, under it, no matter who photographed it, the douchebaggery would always come through.April 13: Tyler, the Creator ft. Kanye West & Lil Wayne ""SMUCKERS""
Hailed by fans as his most ""lyrical"" guest feature of the year, Kanye's flow on ""SMUCKERS"" is reminiscent of songs that appear on Late Registration - Tyler's favorite ""Kanye era"".
They say I'm crazy but that's the best thing going for me / You can't lynch Marshawn, if Tom Brady throwin' to meApril 15: The 100 Most Influential People by TIME Magazine
While Elon Musk penned his profile, TIME also interviewed West. He spoke on breaking the internet, entering the fashion world and surprisingly to most, stated he ""didn't care about being remembered.""
I don't care about having a legacy, I don't care about being remembered. The most important thing to me is like - while I'm here, while we're having fun, while we're going to sleep and breathing oxygen and living life and falling in love and having pain and having joy is like ""What can I do? What can I do with my voice, what can we do each other to make life easier - to make life doper for our kids? You know, as they grow up."" We were born into a broken world and we're like the cleanup crew.
April 20: Kanye West: In His Own Words
Kanye took it back to KanyeUniverseCity days and penned his own cover story for PAPER MAG. He spoke on a range of subjects; from racism, to the Illuminati, and his place in the creative world.
It's funny that I worked at the Gap in high school, because in my past 15 years it seems like that's the place I stood in my creative path -- to be the gap, the bridge.To be continued..."

She said ""don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

(Knock knock knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (you bastard)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (you bastard)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe"

You tried hiding another you
But your evil was coming through
These eyes sitting on the wall
They watch every move I make
Bright light living in the shade

Had to meet the devil just to know his name

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin', or, I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?

Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here

Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here"

5101,1,Love Yourself,Justin Bieber,2016,,,,,1,"For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself"
5102,2,Sorry,Justin Bieber,2016,,,,,1,"You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

Is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm not just trying to get you back on me
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?"

5105,5,Stressed Out,Twenty One Pilots,2016,,,,,1,"I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, an' I care what people think

My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter

My-my name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out

We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', ""Wake up, you need to make money!,"" yeah
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', ""Wake up, you need to make money!,"" yeah

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out

We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', ""Wake up, you need to make money!,"" yeah"

5107,7,Hello,Adele,2016,,,,,1,"Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you, I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you, I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Anymore

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you, I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore"

5109,9,Can't Stop the Feeling!,Justin Timberlake,2016,,,,,1,"I got this feeling inside my bones
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we in our zone

I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops (ooh)
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop

And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine

Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
A feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance (Come on)

Ooh, it's something magical
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on
I don't need no reason, don't need control
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone

'Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop

And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine

Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
A feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance (Come on)
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So keep dancing (Come on)

I can't stop the, I can't stop the
I can't stop the, I can't stop the
I can't stop the feeling

Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
(I can't stop the feeling)
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
(I can't stop the feeling)
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
(I can't stop the feeling)
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

Everybody sing
(I can't stop the feeling)
Got this feeling in my body
(I can't stop the feeling)
Got this feeling in my body
(I can't stop the feeling)
Wanna see you move your body
(I can't stop the feeling)
Got this feeling in my body, come on
Break it down
Got this feeling in my body
Can't stop the feeling
Got this feeling in my body, come on"

5112,12,7 Years,Lukas Graham,2016,,,,,1,"Once I was seven years old my momma told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was 11 years old my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was 11 years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was 20 years old
(Lukas Graham!!!)

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything, I saw before me
Once I was 20 years old
Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be 30 years old

I'm still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month

Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be 60 years old
Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me
Soon I'll be 60 years old

Once I was seven years old, my momma told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old
Once I was seven years old"

On some faded love

Feeling jaded, huh?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to you
Had some fun on the run though I'll give it to you

But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
Fuck ya white horse and ya carriage

Never told you you could have it

You needed me
Oooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less

(Word)
You know what? Free Remy!
Fuck you, Free Remy!
(Fuck Nicki Minaj!)
Are you dumb?
You wore a pink diamond chicken wing chain (Are you dumb?)
You had a leopard beehive on your head (Are you dumb?)
(Fuck Nicki Minaj!)
Are you forgettin' that I pressed you before, bitch?
(Fuck Nicki Minaj!)

(I) Fuck with your soul like shETHER
(Will) You ain't the queen, I'll show you
(Not) Lipo your ass and belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already
They told you your whole career
I'd come home and kill you, right? Ha-ha!

I told you I wasn't talkin' about your dumb-ass
It looks stupid, you literally got a dumb ass
Talkin' cray, and we all know that you dumb as
You get Donkey of the Day, yeah, you dumb ass
Let's be honest, you stole that line 'bout bitches bein' your sons
How you take my '09 jail tweet and run?
Talkin' about bringin' knives to a fight with guns
When the only shot you ever took was in your buns
And I saw Meek at All-Star, he told me your ass dropped
He couldn't fuck you for three months because your ass dropped
Now I don't think y'all understand how bad her ass got
The implants that she had put in her ass popped
I was like, ""Damn, 90 days and you couldn't have box?
Did she at least compensate? Start givin' you mad top?
Her name Minaj, right? She ain't throw you some bad thots?""
He said ""Nah,"" that's when I knew you was really a trash bop
You was screamin' ""Free Remy!"" when I was upstate doomed
But now that they freed Remy you don't sing the same tune
Locked me up, threw away my keys, threw away my weaves
Snatched me from my son, braids to the back, state greens
Daily News, ""Her career's over,"" ""She was kinda stupid,""
But you saw a opportunity 'cause you a opportunist
Left your Day 1 'cause you heard he was on some cheat shit
Then got with the dude that told you on some creep shit
But what happened to Omeeka? Nah, on some G shit
Left him and took a pic with the dude he had beef with?
And we all know it was a beef that you started
Pillow-talkin' out of your ass, this bitch retarded
Now you gotta die, you dearly departed
Bloodbath when I catch you, a real red carpet
Now what I'ma do, I'ma just stick to the facts
Bitch so scared of my future, got this bitch goin' backwards
Been through mad crews, you disloyal hoochie
Now all of a sudden you back with Drake and Tunechi?
After he said you sucked his dick, you back with Gucci?
Who next: Puff, Deb or Fendi? You a A-list groupie
And to be the Queen of Rap, you gotta actually rap
The whole industry know that your shit is a wrap
No, to be the Queen of Rap, you can't have a ghostwriter
And that's why this is my house; Flo Rida
Niggas done seen Drake pennin', Wayne pennin'
And since your first boyfriend left, bitch ain't winnin'
You a Internet troll, a Web browser, I'm sorry
You can't get a on line without Safaree
Mentionin' guns, you Pussy Galore, James Bond
Only time you touch a trigga is when you fucked Trey Songz
Coke head, you cheated on your man with Ebro
I might leak the footage of you sniffin' them ski slopes
They gassin' you up, but you been on E, though
""Pills and Potions,"" yep, you been on E, ho
Got your ghostwriters back, so you think you lit
Rem Belushi, I'm a Ghostbuster, bitch
I'm supposed to be scared
'Cause you bought your Barbie chain back?
I'll revert to ""Ante Up,"" you'll get your Barbie chain yapped
Tried to front in February, catch you in that Maybach
Show you how to use your name, you be usin' your name wack
I'm sayin', how you mix Nicki with a Minaj?
I'ma park this bitch, put Nicki in the garage
I'm gettin' money like Nicky Barnes, I'm the big homie
I responded in less than 48 Hours; Nick Nolte
Gettin' close like Nick Jonas, grippin' the gauge
Then blaze off, Face Off, bitch, Nicolas Cage
You animated like Nickelodeon, you fake, bitch
Only the kids believe in you; you St. Nick
Now when I shoot Nick at Nite, they won't understand it
I'm Wild'n Out, 'bout to hit Nick with the Cannon
How are you on the VMAs, actin' like you hood?
Way across the stage, talkin' about ""Miley, what's good?""
That's Hannah Montana, she was always happy
You only fronted on Mariah 'cause Mariah don't carry
Tried to disrespect Taylor 'cause Taylor wasn't Swift enough
Pillsbury Doughgirl; Remy pick the biscuit up
I'm jealous? Bitch, you was happy when they took me
Best thing that ever happened to you was when they booked me
You said you never fucked Wayne – how stupid I look, B?
Get the picture, I'll expose you, I'm kind of a bully
You named yourself Nicki Lewinsky, the mind of a rookie
'Cause you was suckin' his dick and now he tired of your nookie
You claimed you never fucked Drake
Now that's where you took me
You fucked the whole Empire – who you tryin' to be, Cookie?
Boogie Down Bronx, I come out of the Boogie
To let you know real bitches never lie on their pussy
And stop talkin' numbers, you signed a 360 deal
Through Young Money, through Cash Money, through Republic
Which means your money go through five niggas before you touch it
Any videos, promotions come out of your budget
Endorsements, tour and merchandise, they finger-fuck it
You make, like, 35 cents off of each ducat
I own my masters, bitch, independent
So for every sale I do, you gotta do like ten
Stop comparin' yourself to Jay, you not like him
You a motherfuckin' worker, not a boss like Rem
You're done, them pop chicks ain't get the news yet
Bitch, I pop chicks, yeah, and I'm the new vet
I kill rappers, and you good as dead, bitch
Talkin' shit about me to a deaf bitch
And usually I have sympathy for the impaired
But not when you hard of hearin' from untreated gonorrhea
But you point your fingers at me? I’m the bad girl
When she the one out here misleadin' the black girls?
All these fake-asses influenced by that girl
Dyin' from botched surgeries – what a sad world!
But before the butt job, you was a Spongebob
Suckin' cock for records, captain of the cum squad
And I got a few words for the moms of the young Barbz
Guess who supports a child molester? Nicki Minaj
You paid for your brother’s wedding? That’s hella foul
How you spendin' money to support a pedophile?
He a walkin' dead man, sendin' threats to him
I guess that’s why they call you Barbie, you was next to Ken
Talkin’ about your money long and your foreign sick
Why you ain’t help your bro hide his cum from forensics?
You probably somewhere overseas, foreign sick
Thought you could fuck with me, by far Rem sick
Meek, Drake, Safaree, I see men in your pants
We call that Jelani, get it? Semen in your pants
Uh, I got trigger fingers, you got bitter fingers
Yeah, you must think you Drake and I'm Twitter fingers
VH1, watch this
You just got bodied by a Love & Hip-Hop bitch

Don't ever in your fuckin' life play with me
That's on the set!
You tried it on the Rae Sremmurd record
You tried it on your little freestyle
They was both duds, just like every other one was duds
Just like this last one was a dud
But what you not gonna do is keep subbin' me
Big… Pun!
I send a fuckin' headshot, you dead, bitch!
Will not lose!"

To show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt 10 years older

I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes

All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

I'm just a singer who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers
Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
'Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up

Now you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster
And be all alone

Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing

All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

I took a plane to my home town
I brought my pride and my guitar
All my friends are all gone but there's manicured lawns
And the people still think I'm a star
I walked around downtown
I met some fans on Lafayette
They said tell us how to make it cause we're getting real impatient
So I looked 'em in the eye and said

You don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster
And be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing

Solo ride until I die
‘Cause I got me for life (louder)
Ooh, I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul

And as far as I can see, I just need privacy
Plus a whole lot of tree, fuck all this modesty
I just need space to do me
Give the world what they're tryna see
A Stella Maxwell right beside of me
A Ferrari, I'm buyin' three
A closet of Saint Laurent, get what I want when I want
‘Cause this hunger is drivin' me here
I just need to be alone, I just need to be at home
Understand what I'm speakin' on
If time is money I need a loan
But regardless I'll always keep keepin' on

I'm tryna be cool, but I may just go ape shit
Say ""Fuck y'all!"" to all of y'all faces
It changes though now that I'm famous
Everyone knows how this lifestyle is dangerous
But I love it, the rush is amazin'
Celebrate nightly and everyone rages
I found how to cope with my angers
I'm swimmin' in money
Swimmin' in liquor, my liver is muddy
But it's all good, I'm still sippin' this bubbly
This shit is lovely, this shit ain't random, I didn't get lucky
Made it right here ‘cause I'm sick with it, cuddy

You'll have some weird people sitting next to you
You'll think ""How did I get here, sitting next to you?""
But after all I've said, please don't forget

All my friends are heathens, take it slow (In the city, boy, in the city)
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

All my friends are heathens, take it slow (Watch it)
Wait for them to ask you who you know (Watch it)
Please all my friends are heathens, take it slow (Watch it)
Wait for them to ask you who you know

Why'd you come? You knew you should have stayed (It's blasphemy)
I tried to warn you just to stay away (Wouldn't listen to me)
And now they're outside ready to bust (To bust) (And guess what?)
It looks like you might be one of us"

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Oh, you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart, cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own

Got a feeling that I'm going under

Running out of pages in your passport

Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

And you can tell me if I'm off

When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me too
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do

'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can

Give me a sign
Take my hand, we'll be fine
Promise I won't let you down
Just know that you don't
Have to do this alone
Promise I'll never let you down

And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying

And people like to laugh at you cause they are all the same, mmm, mmm
See I would rather we just go a different way than play the game
And no matter the weather, we can do it better
You and me together, forever and ever
We don't have to worry 'bout a thing, 'bout a thing

We came here to run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it, run it, run it

Just like fire, burnin' up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way
Just like magic,  I'll be flyin' free
I'mma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me anyway
Just like fire, fire, fire
Run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it, run it, run it

So look, I came here to run it
Just cause nobody's done it
Y'all don't think I can run it
But look, I been here, I done it
Impossible? Please
Watch, I do it with ease
You just gotta believe
Come uh, come uh with me
Oh, what's a girl to do?
(What, what?)
Hey, what's a girl to do?
(What, what?)
Oh, what's a girl to do?
(What, what?)
Mmmm, what's a girl to do?

Just like fire, burnin' up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way

Just like fire, burnin' up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way
Just like magic,  I'll be flyin' free
I'mma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me anyway
Just like fire, fire

Run it, run it, run it
Just like fire
Run it, run it, run it"

I want you bad as ever
Don't let me just let up
I wanna give you better
Baby, it's whatever
Somebody gotta step up
Girl, I'm that somebody, so I'm next up
Be damned if I let him catch up
It's easy to see that you're fed up
I am on a whole 'nother level
Girl, he only fucked you over 'cause you let him
Fuck him, girl, I guess he didn't know any better
Girl, that man didn't show any effort
Do all I can just to show you you're special
Certain it's your love that holds me together
Lately you say he been killin' the vibe
Gotta be sick of this guy
Pull up, skrr, get in the ride
Left hand is steerin' the other is grippin' your thigh
Light up a spliff and get high
Shawty, you deserve what you've been missin'
Lookin' at you I'm thinkin' he must be trippin'
Play this song for him, tell him, ""Just listen""

Don't
Don't

Girl, said he keeps on playin' games
And his lovin' ain't the same
I don't know what to say, but
What a shame
If you were mine you would not get the same
If you were mine you would top everything
Suicide in the drop switchin' lanes
And that thing so fire, baby, no propane
Got good pussy, girl, can I be frank?
To keep it 100, girl, I ain't no saint
But he the only reason that I'm feelin' this way
Givin' you the world, baby, when you get space
Pen game get me laid, baby, that's penetrate
Oh baby

Don't

H-Town got a nigga so throwed
Pour up, we can party some more
Yeah, got this drank in my cup
Got a young nigga feelin' so throwed
Spit fire in a world so cold
Young money got a nigga feelin' old
Spit fire in a world so cold
H-Town got me feelin' so throwed

I'm locked and loaded

All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God

Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't

Know what I'm doing

TAYLOR opens Apple Music.
TAYLOR: Activity playlists, running...#GYMFLOW. Drake and Future.
""Jumpman"" by Drake and Future starts playing. Taylor starts mouthing the words. She is running on a treadmill.

If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you
Yeah, yeah
Halloween
I'm gon' shoot you

TAYLOR starts rapping the song out loud.

Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, them boys up to something
They just spent like two or three weeks out the country
Them boys up to something, they just not just bluffing
You don't have to call, I hit my dance like Usher, woo
I just found my tempo like I'm DJ Mustard, woo
I hit that Ginobili with my left hand up like wo--
TAYLOR falls face-first onto the treadmill while it is still running. It carries her off and throws her onto the floor, face down. Meanwhile, ""Jumpman"" is still playing.

Lobster and Céline for all my babies that I miss
Chicken fingers, French fries for them that wanna diss

5138,38,"I Hate U, I Love U",Gnash featuring Olivia O'Brien,2016,,,,,1,"Feeling used, but I'm
Still missing you and I can't
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss against my lips
And now all this time is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart, too
And I'm always tired, but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text, but then I never mind that shit
I got these feelings, but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me, but your friends don't know
If you wanted me, you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

I don't mean no harm, I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

All alone, I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care, you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah, all alone, I watch you watch her
She is the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me?

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her"
5139,39,Here,Alessia Cara,2016,,,,,1,"I guess right now you've got the last laugh

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin', or, I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?

Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here

Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here"

Like a scene from a movie that every broken heart knows
We were walking on moonlight, and you pulled me close
Split second and you disappeared and then I was all alone
I woke up in tears, with you by my side
A breath of relief, and I realized
No, we're not promised tomorrow

So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you, like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing, I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you

In the blink of an eye, just a whisper of smoke
You could lose everything, the truth is you never know
So I'll kiss you longer babe (hey) any chance that I get
I'll make the most of the minutes and love with no regret
So let's take our time to say what we want
Use what we got before it's all gone
'Cause no, we're not promised tomorrow

So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you, like I'm saying goodbye

Come along with me and don't be scared
I just wanna set you free
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
You and me can make it anywhere
But for now, we can stay here for a while

No matter where you go
You know you're not alone

I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
I'm only one call away

And when you're weak, I'll be strong
I'm gonna keep holding on
Now don't you worry, it won't be long
Darling, and when you feel like hope is gone
Just run into my arms

I'm only one call away

5144,44,Let It Go,James Bay,2016,,,,,1,"From walking home and talking loads
To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch and getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you

Now we're sleeping near the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees

So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore?

I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away

So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

Tryna fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
'Cause no force on earth could make it feel right, no, no
Tryna push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
I think now's the time to let it slide

So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall, forget about me

Come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

You broke through and saved me

You're an angel, tell me you're never leavin'

High on lovin' you
You're holy, holy
Holy, holy
I'm high on lovin' you
High on lovin' you

You made the brightest days from the darkest nights
You're the river bank where I was baptized
Cleansed from the demons
That were killin' my freedom
Let me lay you down, give me to ya
Get you singin', babe, hallelujah
We'll be touchin'
We'll be touchin' heaven

Bricks comin' in somewhere on the rim
Section doin' numbers, nowhere by a gym
Droppin' bottles, spend, I'm supplyin' ten
Jumpin' out a Honda, I just got it in
Askin' what I cop, none of your concern

Engagin' where I'm gazin' at her hips
And ain't nobody makin' no attempts

Do you ever ask yourself
Is it just me, is it just me
Is this sex so good I shouldn't have to fuck for free?
(Verse 1:)
I want a bad chick
She got a body
A real bad bitch
She knows how I like to party
On a mattress
With a handle of Bacardi
And the fact is
You know we're just getting started
I want a bad chick
Not an Instagram model
Ima go to campus
Alpha phi is such a brothel
And this shit is madness
So I drink another bottle
Ima drink this shit
Till the ladies look like models
Back up back up
Back it up for me girl
You such a bragger wasssup
Come and work for me girl
I got a fat cup filled up
Come and give me a twirl
And we gon stack up my luck
Till I finally hurl
I got this party on lock
Somebody pass me the rock
I'm bout to pop the top off someone hand me a shot
This girl has got a hot bod like she been doin squats
And you know that I can't stop till I got her on top haha
(Verse 2:)
You know I came to fuckin ball in the city man
Grew up in OC where all pretty ladies land
I used to play baseball and a couple bands
We'd shoplift at the mall alcohol get slammed
And I'll be damned if the plan wasn't to expand
Recently we in demand with the music man
I got the right wrist band on my right hand
About to make a couple grand with the right brand
I got fat stacks playin games of black jack
She wants my hat back but she cannot have that
I gave her mad cash I can't even add that
She had a bad dad that's why she's a badass
I'm on the fast track yea we fuckin passed that
Put you on blast jack better get your hazmat
I wanna tap that so I gotta trap that
She's got an ass tat likes it when I rap fast"

Between the bottle of wine and the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain

And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man
A happy man, baby, mmm

Baby, that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh, but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
You’re a saint, you’re a goddess, the cutest, the hottest, a masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you in my wildest dreams

And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man, yeah, yeah
Mmm

I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination
Baby, you're my great escape
We could stay at home, listen to the radio
Dance around the fireplace

Oh, if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man

Baby, I could die a happy man
Oh, I could die a happy man
You know I could, girl
I could die, I could die a happy man

Do he dress every day, like it's Easter Sunday?
Can he give me more head, than Peggy Bundy?
Man, fuck I look like turnin' down some dome?
Man that's sorta like a dog turnin' down some bone
Nigga know that I'm a 10, that's Celine on my lens

Lord, I'm on fire, they think that I'm Satan
Callin' me crazy on different occasions
Kickin' the cameraman off of my stages
'Cause I don't like how he snappin' my angles
I'm overboard and I'm over-impatient
Over my niggas and these kids my ages
Dealin' with Mo' shit that's more complicated
Like these two bitches that might be related
H-Town, you got one
And you Bun B like a number one
It's late night, got a late show
If you wanna roll, I got a place where, ahh

Poppin' pills is all we know (Ooh!)
In the hills is all we know (Hollywood!)
Don't go through the front door (Through the back!)
It's lowkey at the night show (Ooh!)
So don't you open up that window (Ooh!)
Don't you let out that antidote"
5176,76,Lost Boy,Ruth B,2016,,,,,1,"There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the Moon
And even sometimes he would go away too
Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for a while
He said, ""Peter Pan that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely""
And ever since that day...

I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan and
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
""Run, run Lost Boy,"" they say to me
Away from all of reality
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free

He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny
As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough we reached Neverland
Peacefully my feet hit the sand
And ever since that day...

I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan and
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
""Run, run Lost Boy,"" they say to me
Away from all of reality
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free

Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Wendy Darling
Even Captain Hook, you are my perfect storybook
Neverland, I love you so, you are now my home sweet home
Forever a Lost Boy at last
Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Wendy Darling
Even Captain Hook, you are my perfect storybook
Neverland, I love you so, you are now my home sweet home

But then he wanna take control

Had 7 men to do the chores

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa

I said, ""No one has to know what we do""
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request, it is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah haa (ah-aah haa)

Coffee has gone cold, it's like time froze

There you go wishin', floatin' down our wishin' well
It's like I'm always causin' problems, causin' hell
I didn't mean to put you through this, I can tell
Are we gonna sweep this under the carpet?

I hope that I can turn back the time
To make it all alright, all alright for us
I'll promise to build a new world
For us two with you in the middle

Am I just overthinkin' feelings I can sell?
This gut feelin' I'm tryna get off me as well
I hope we find our missin' pieces and just chill

It's a little blurry how the whole thing started
I don't even really know what you intended
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous
Poured it down, so I poured it down
Next thing that I know I'm in a hotel with you
You were talking deep like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down, so I poured it down

And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand

Talking 'bout a girl, 'bout a girl with my name
Saying that I hurt you but I still don't get it
You didn't love me, no, not really
Wait
I could have really liked you
I'll bet, I'll bet that's why I keep on thinking 'bout you
It's a shame (shame), you said I was good

Why I got you on my mi-i-i-i-ind

You got yourself in a dangerous zone
Cause we both have the fear, fear of being alone

And I still don't understand it

Understand it, understand it

From the way you talk to the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you'd moved overseas
That's what you said when you left me

You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)

It's hard to admit that everything just takes me back
To when you were there, to when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on just in case it hasn't gone
'Cause I still care, do you still care?

It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old, it makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young"

The ones who get undressed before the second date
Girls seem to like the boys who don't appreciate
All the money and the time that it takes

To be fly as a mother
Got my both eyes out for Mr. Right
Guessing I just don't know where to find 'em
But I hope they all come out tonight

Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
I'm a good good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?

Boys seem to like the girls who like to kiss and tell
Talking them up about the things they do so well
But I'd rather find a boy who is down for the chase
Putting in the time that it takes

To be fly as a mother
To supply all of my heart's demands
Suit and tie, cause undercover
He's gonna save my life like Superman

Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
I'm a good good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?

Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Won't somebody tell me, tell me?
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go

Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
I'm a good good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?

Hide away, hide away
Looking high and low, someone let me know

Will you be there by my side?
Standing strong as the waves roll over

When the nights are long
Longing for you to come home

The remix for the city, let's just start snappin'
Crack hit Bleek on the jack, like, ""Let's make it happen!""
Oh, it's me

Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up (It's me, uh-huh)
All the way up (It's me, uh-huh)
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up

Shorty, what you want? Shorty, what you need?
My niggas run the game, we ain't never leavin'
Countin' up this money, we ain't never sleepin'
You got V12, I got 12 V's (Skrr!)
Got bottles, got weed, got molly (Molly!) (I'm all the way up)
I'm all the way up
Shorty, what you want? I got what you need

I'm all the way up
All the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up
Turn me all the way up, Dre!

You know you made it when the fact your marriage made it is worth millions
Lemonade is a popular drink and it still is (woo!)
Survival of the littest
Niggas who really up vers' niggas up in your business
I'm in the room where real niggas not allowed (woo!)
I'm the only one in the room that they fear right now (woo!)
I think they're clear right now
Let's celebrate, no red Champagne, we don't play that
All we see is gold bottles and paper plane hats
21 Grammys that I use for D'USSÉ cups
I'm on the penthouse floor, call your way up
The OG's say, ""HOV, how high is high enough?""
I said, ""Till we eye and eye with the higher-ups""
Until we let 'em know, we ain't those niggas
Until our babies showered in gold, nigga
Blue lookin' like Pac in the tub
David LaChapelle levels of not givin' a fuck
Prince left his masters where they safe and sound
We never gonna let the elevator take us down, aaaahhh!

I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
Yo, Pecas! What up, homie?
I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up

This wasn't me, this was God's doing
And this time I won't finger roll; Pat Ewing
They ain't wanna see the Squad and the Roc
Now they chasin' the Wraith, like Mister Softee's on the block
Stars on the roof got her feelin' like Venus
Gettin' so much brain now I'm a Don CartaGenius
Ever since Pun been gone, been independent
So I went and threw the Pun Jumpman up in the pendant
Ha! I flooded out all the Christ's
Out in Paris, I learned what real ice is
Hee-shee, I'm kickin' flava' in your ear
I just had a gray on my face and it disappeared
I just dropped the biggest of checks, and the shit cleared
When everybody counted us out just this year
Uh, I'm Steph Curry in the clutch
Take a shot of this Royal Elite, and go all the way up!

All the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up
All the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up

My swag, my flow, I stole it back
They mad, too bad, my shows is packed
My town, my crown, I really rap
I'm home, my throne, I spoil you that
When the bitch was gone, they was really playin' with it
I was sittin' listenin', like, ""They ain't even sayin' shit!""
Now the real is back, I see they all tryna change and shit
But it's really too late now, I'm goin' back (Go!)
One of these bitches, two of these bitches gotta die
Three of these bitches, four of these bitches gonna cry
Five of these bitches poppin' pills, they high
Six bird bitches, none of them get fly
See, I don't wanna hear about your records and big numbers
‘Cause I was up top seven winters and six summers
Cuffed, all in that bus, locked me all the way down
Now I'm all the way up

All the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up

Where she been, trying to read all of her messages
I don't speak on no man, that's irregular
Take her phone, disconnectin' her cellular
What you need that for undressin' her?
What you need that for caressin' her?
Spreading her legs 'bout to pleasure her
Pulling her hair from the back, go to pressin' her
Trying to see who tap first, made a bet with her
Relationship flaking, no eczema
She catching feelings, she say we inseparable
Oyster Perpetual, it's not a replica
Mustang GT in the streets, smoking vegetables
Trunk in the front, do it make me a elephant?
I really really put syrup in my beverages
Shopping in Beverly, check out my etiquette
Loving my swag, women tailor keep checking it

You know just how to make my heart beat faster
Emotional earthquake, bring on disaster
You hit me head on, got me weak in my knees

Yeah, something inside me's changed
I was so much younger yesterday, so much younger yesterday

I didn't know that I was starving 'til I tasted you
Don't need no butterflies when you give me the whole damn zoo

Don't forget the keys under the mat
When childhood stars shine
Always stay humble and kind
Go to church 'cause your momma says to
Visit grandpa every chance that you can
It won't be wasted time
Always stay humble and kind

Hold the door, say please, say thank you
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb but
Always stay humble and kind
When the dreams you're dreamin' come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind

Don't expect a free ride from no one
Don't hold a grudge or a chip and here's why
Bitterness keeps you from flyin'
Always stay humble and kind
Know the difference between sleepin' with someone
And sleepin' with someone you love
""I love you"" ain't no pickup line, so
Always stay humble and kind

Hold the door, say please, say thank you
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb but
Always stay humble and kind
When those dreams you're dreamin' come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind (Yeah)

When it's hot, eat a root beer popsicle
Shut off the AC and roll the windows down
Let that summer sun shine
Always stay humble and kind
Don't take for granted the love this life gives you

And help the next one in line

I might never be the one you take home to mother
And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
But I can be the one, be the one tonight

When I first saw you from across the room
I could tell that you were curious, oh yeah
Girl, I hope you're sure what you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises

But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then, baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Then, baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now

I might never be the hands you put your heart in
Or the arms that hold you any time you want them
But that don't mean that we can't live here in the moment
'Cause I can be the one you love from time to time

When I first saw you, from across the room
I could tell that you were curious, oh yeah
Girl, I hope you're sure what you're looking for

And if you like going places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Then, baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now

And if you like cameras flashing every time we go out, oh yeah
And if you're looking for someone
To write your breakup songs about
Baby, I'm perfect
Baby, we're perfect

If you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do

Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much

Make me wanna savor every moment slowly, slowly
You fit me tailor-made, love how you put it on
Got the only key, know how to turn it on
The way you nibble on my ear, the only words I wanna hear

¡Oh! Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Sólo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (Oh, yeah)
Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito

Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (Woah, woah)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Woah, woah)

Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo, yo sé que estás pensándolo
Llevo tiempo intentándolo, mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bom, bom
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bom, bom
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empecemos lento, después salvaje

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza
¡Oye!

Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo

Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito

I just wanna hear you screaming, ""¡Ay, Bendito!""
I can move forever cuando esté contigo

The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spiderman's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list

But she said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss

I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

Oh, I want something just like this
I want something just like this

I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
The testaments they told
The moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls
A suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits

She said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can miss

I want something just like this
I want something just like this

Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

Where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this

Oh, I want something just like this

5208,8,Body Like a Back Road,Sam Hunt,2017,,,,,1,"Got a girl from the south side, got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell up out my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet, man
It ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

We're out here in the boondocks
With the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass
With my lips on hers
On a highway to heaven
Headed south of her smile mmm
Get there when we get there
Every inch is a mile

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

I'ma take it slow
Just as fast as I can
Body like a back road
Drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Got braids in her hair"

I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulkin' to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

I was chokin' in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...

5211,11,Say You Won't Let Go,James Arthur,2017,,,,,1,"I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool
When I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed
I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more
Than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise 'til death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go"

Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinking
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

Getting so gone I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
There is nothin' to explain
I'm a fuckin' black Beatle, cream seats in the Regal
Rockin' John Lennon lenses, like to see ‘em spread eagle
Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table
Screamin', ""Everybody's famous!""
Like clockwork, I blow it all
And get some more
Get you somebody that can do both
Black Beatles got the babes belly rollin'

Why you bring the money machine to the club for?
Pint of lean, pound of weed, and a kilo

15 hundred on my feet, I'm tryna kill these haters
I had haters when I was broke, I'm rich, I still got haters
I had hoes when I was broke, I'm rich, I'm still a player
I wear leather Gucci jackets like it's still the 80s

Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who in front of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months, what bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me

I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap

And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter is gold, tell that lil' bitch play her role
I just arrove in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott

We were sipping whiskey neat
Highest floor, The Bowery
And nowhere's high enough
Somewhere along the lines
We stopped seeing eye to eye
You were staying out all night
And I had enough

No, I don't wanna know
Where you been or where you're going
But I know I won't be home
And you'll be on your own

Who's gonna walk you
Through the dark side of the morning?
Who's gonna rock you
When the sun won't let you sleep?
Who's waking up to drive you home
When you're drunk and all alone?
Who's gonna walk you
Through the dark side of the morning?

It ain't me
The Bowery, whiskey neat...
It ain't me
Now I'm free, girl
And I moved on
It ain't me

It ain't me

I had a dream
We were back to seventeen
Summer nights and The Libertines
Never growing up
I'll take with me
The polaroids and the memories
But you know I'm gonna leave
Behind the worst of us

Who's gonna walk you
Through the dark side of the morning?
Who's gonna rock you (Rock yoooouuu)
When the sun won't let you sleep?
Who's waking up to drive you home
When you're drunk and all alone?
Who's gonna walk you
Through the dark side of the morning?

Dostum, sikeyim
Sorun ne Kyle?
Dostum, bu çocuklar, boş boş konuşup sinirimi bozuyorlar
Aga, sikeyim o çocukları, hayatına bak aga, etrafına bak
Dostum.. Haklısın
Hmm, şuradaki sağlam orospuları görüyor musun?
Vay, evet
Şu ağaçları görüyor musun? Peki ya şu suyu?
Sanırım sorun falan yok
Hadi ama kardeşim, şükretmen gereken çok şey var
Aga.. Düşündüm de.. Haklısın
Çok haklısın ki çok haklıyım. Çok haksız olduğum bir gün bile hatırlamıyorum
Sağol Lil Boat, dostum
Kanka, bu yüzden buradayım

Son zamanlarda kafayı bulmuyordum...
Pekala, belki biraz bebeğim, yalan söylemek istemiyorum
Bana mesaj attığında, kızım, her zaman cevap vermiyorum biliyorum
Sen bir melek değilsin, uçamıyorsun bile
Fark ediyorum ki, bir şeyler bildiğini sanıyorsun
Tüm bu hayaletler bana doğru geliyor, kimin fırlattığını merak ediyorum
Vizyonu göremiyorlar, dostum dikkatlari dağılmış olmalı
Bu gerçekten güzel bir albüm ahbap, kim yazdı merak ediyorum, oh lanet olsun
Tamam, o zencilerin gitmesini diliyorum
Cirque Du Soleil gibi her zaman etrafta palyaçolar var
Bu bir albüm değil, hatta bunlar sadece gelişi güzeller
Bu şey çok soğuk, piyasaya sürüldüğünde kar günü olacak
Ayy, o iyi ve bunu biliyor, söylemiyor, sadece gösteriyor
Ben tıpkı DeRozan gibiyim, shoot atarsam girer
Cali'de güneşleniyorum, onlar o kadar ıslanıyor ki kızağa ihtiyaçları var
Oprah ile selfie'im var, sadece paylaşasım yok
Mutlu mekanımda takılıyorum, 2006' dan beri somurtmuyorum
2001' den beri ağlamıyorum, benim mekanım Six Flags gibi ve senin evin
Hiç eğlenceli değil
Benimkine geri de gelebilirsin, arkadaşın tatlı değil
Fakat sorun değil
Yüksek notada bitireceğiz

Küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Elde edebileceğim bir kız çünkü çok fazla beğeni almıyor
Kıvırcık tatlı bir kız, karım olabilir
Dur, bu hep, sonsuzluk anlamına geliyor, bekle, boş ver
Oh, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Elde edebileceğim bir kız çünkü çok fazla beğeni almıyor
Kıvırcık tatlı bir kız, karım olabilir
Dur, bu hep, sonsuzluk anlamına geliyor, bekle, boş ver

Oh, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Gözlüyorum, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Oh, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Gözlüyorum, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Oh ben...

21 yaşında olduğunu söylüyor, kimlik görmem gerek
Bütün orospularım çift çift geliyor aşağıdaki taşaklarım gibi
Bir Hatchback'te şehri turladığım günleri hatırlıyorum
Genç goblinlerimle bir sorun arıyoruz
Modelimi evine boynundaki ağrılarla gönderiyorum
O kadar çok para kazandım ki durdurulamıyor
Kardeşlerim soyadım gibi yanımdadır
Herkese evcilleşmeyeceğimi söylediğim zamanlar aklımda
Woah, altı ay sonra ters döndüm ve şimdi oyundayım
Sahte zincir kolyelerden bambaşka seviyelerde elmaslar
""Beni buradan alabilir misiniz?"" sveiyesinden buraya geldim
Beni siklemeyen bir sürü insanı hatırlıyorum
Üniversiteye gittiler, şimdi hepsi tarih oldu
Dişimdeki altını elmasa dönüştürdüm
Arabamızda sert takılıyoruz, gizemli şeyler peşindeyiz (Raggy!)
Beni siklememeye devam et
Uzun zamandır lüks içinde yaşıyorum, hayır
Boat ve Kyle piyano tuşları gibi birbirinden ayrılmaz
Anneannemin üstüne yemin ederim ki asla bir orospuyu kondomsuz sikmem

Küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Elde edebileceğim bir kız çünkü çok fazla beğeni almıyor
Kıvırcık tatlı bir kız, karım olabilir
Dur, bu hep, sonsuzluk anlamına geliyor, bekle, boş ver
Oh, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Elde edebileceğim bir kız çünkü çok fazla beğeni almıyor
Kıvırcık tatlı bir kız, karım olabilir
Dur, bu hep, sonsuzluk anlamına geliyor, bekle, boş ver

She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful"
5231,31,1-800-273-8255,Logic featuring Alessia Cara and Khalid,2017,,,,,1,"Ich bin im Tief gewesen
Ich hab mir Zeit gelassen
Ich fühle mich als hab ich meinen Verstand verloren
Es fühlt sich an als wäre mein Leben nicht meins
Wer kann es verstehen?
Ich bin im Tief gewesen
Ich hab mir Zeit gelassen
Ich fühle mich als hab ich meinen Verstand verloren
Es fühlt sich an als wäre mein Leben nicht meins

Ich will nicht lebendig sein
Ich will nicht lebendig sein
Ich will heute einfach sterben
Ich will einfach sterben
Ich will nicht lebendig sein
Ich will nicht lebendig sein
Ich will einfach sterben
Und lass mich dir sagen warum

All der andere Scheiß, über den ich rede, sie denken sie wissen es
Ich habe gebetet, damit mich jemand rettet, keiner ist heldenhaft
Und mein  Leben bedeutet nichts
Ich weiß es, ich weiß es, ich weiß, dass ich tief in mir verletzt bin, aber kann es nicht zeigen
Ich hatte nie einen Ort, den ich mein Eigen nennen konnte
Ich hatte nie ein Zuhause
Keiner ruft mein Handy an
Wo warst du? Wo bist du? Was geht in dir vor?
Sie sagen jedes Leben ist wertvoll, doch interessiert sich für meins

Ich bin im Tief gewesen
Ich hab mir Zeit gelassen
Ich fühle mich als hab ich meinen Verstand verloren
Es fühlt sich an als wäre mein Leben nicht meins
Wer kann es verstehen?
Ich bin im Tief gewesen
Ich hab mir Zeit gelassen
Ich fühle mich als hab ich meinen Verstand verloren
Es fühlt sich an als wäre mein Leben nicht meins

Ich will, dass du lebendig bist
Ich will, dass du lebendig bist
Du musst heute nicht sterben
Du musst nicht sterben
Ich will, dass du lebendig bist
Ich will, dass du lebendig bist
Du musst heute nicht sterben
Jetzt lass mich dir sagen warum

Es ist der erste Atemzug
Wenn dein Kopf im Wasser untergegangen ist
Und die Leichtheit in der Luft
Wenn du da bist
Brust zu Brust mit einem Geliebten
Es ist Weitermachen, auch wenn der Weg lang ist
Und Licht in den dunkelsten Dingen zu sehen
Und wenn du deine Reflektion anstarrst
Endlich zu wissen wer es ist
Ich weiß, dass du Gott danken wirst, dass du es getan hast

Ich weiß wo du warst, wo du bist, wohin du gehst
Ich wieß, dass du der Grund bist, warum ich ans Leben glaube
Was ist der Tag mit einer kleinen Nacht?
Es kann schwer sein
Es kann so schwer sein
Aber du musst jetzt leben
Du musst jetzt alles geben

Ich bin im Tief gewesen
Ich hab mir Zeit gelassen
Ich fühle mich als hab ich meinen Verstand verloren
Es fühlt sich an als wäre mein Leben nicht meins
Wer kann es verstehen?
Ich bin im Tief gewesen
Ich hab mir Zeit gelassen
Ich fühle mich als hab ich meinen Verstand verloren
Es fühlt sich an als wäre mein Leben nicht meins

Ich will endlich lebendig sein
Ich will endlich lebendig sein
Ich will heute nicht sterben
Ich will nicht sterben
Ich will endlich lebendig sein
Ich will endlich lebendig sein
Ich will nicht sterben
Ich will nicht sterben

Schmerz tut nicht so weh, ich weiß
Die Spur, die ich fahre, fühlt sich einsam an
Aber ich bewege mich bis meine Beine aufgeben
Und ich sehe meine Tränen im Schnee schmelzen
Aber ich will nicht weinen
Ich will nicht mehr weinen
Ich will mich lebendig fühlen
Ich will sogar nicht mehr sterben
Oh ich will nicht
Ich will nicht
Ich will sogar nicht mehr sterben"

If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like a edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane
(Thank you, God, God bless you, thank you so much)

Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen courtrooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I’m takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bitch, bounce (Yeah)
Is you a real one?
Is you a real one?
Real one
Real one
Is you a real one?
Real one

Yo yo

Sabes, he estado tomándome algo de tiempo
Y he estado guardándome
Tenia la vista en el premio
No veía a nadie mas
Pero, tu amor me golpeó duro, nena
Si, eres mala para mi salud
Me encantan las tarjetas que me has estado enviando
¿Sientes lo mismo también?

Ya sabes, yo solía estar en 1D (ahora soy libre)
La gente me quiere para una cosa (que no soy)
No estoy cambiando mi forma de ser (solía ser)
Solo quiero divertirme (y estar alborotado)
Una coca-cola y bacardi (bebiendo ligeramente)
Cuando camino dentro de la fiesta (las chicas vienen a mi)
Tipo F1 Ferrari (con seis velocidades)
Nena, me encanta cuando tu cuerpo (Me agobia)

Tu sabes que me encanta cuando la música esta alta
Pero vamos, quítate eso para mi, bebe
Ahora hay mucha gente en la multitud
Pero, tu solo puedes bailar conmigo
Pon las manos en mi cuerpo
Y muévete a mi alrededor, bebe
Tu sabes que me encanta cuando la música esta alta
Pero vamos, quítate eso para mi, bebe
Oh, quítate eso chica
Amo cuando golpeas el suelo, chica
Oh, quítate eso chica
Amo cuando golpeas el suelo, chica

Sabes, desde el día que te conocí
Si, me has quitado los pies
Sabes que no necesito dinero
Cuando tu amor esta a mi lado
Si, has abierto mi corazón
Y luego has tirado la llave
Chica, ahora solo somos tu y yo
Y a ti no te importa donde yo haya estado

Ya sabes, yo solía estar en 1D (ahora soy libre)

Palabras alrededor de la ciudad, ella tiene el zumbido (palabras)
Cinco tiros, ella esta enamorada ahora (tiros)
Lo prometo, cuando nos detenemos, cerramos el club hacia abajo
La tomé de su hombre, nadie lo sabe (sabe)
Si te compras el CL, mejor conduce lento (lento)
Ella sabe como hacerme sentir con mis ojos cerrados
Nada se viene abajo con el Huncho (Huncho)

Tu sabes que me encanta cuando la música esta alta
Pero vamos, quítate eso para mi, bebe
Ahora hay mucha gente en la multitud
Pero, tu solo puedes bailar conmigo

5240,40,Castle on the Hill,Ed Sheeran,2017,,,,,1,"When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill"

Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

Nothing's that bad
If it feels good
So you come back
Like I knew you would
And we're both wild
And the night's young
And you're my drug
Breathe you in 'til my face numb
Drop it down to that bass drum
I got what you dream about
Nails scratchin' my back tatt
Eyes closed while you scream out
And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life
And you suffocate in my kiss
Then you said

I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?

I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

I can't explain it
I love the pain
And I love the way your breath
Numbs me like novacaine
And we are
Always high
Keep it strange
Okay, yeah, I'm insane
But you the same
Let me paint the picture
Couch by the kitchen
Nothin' but your heels on
Losin' our religion
You're my pretty little vixen
And I'm the voice inside your head
That keeps telling you to listen to all the bad things I say
And you said

I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like

What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

The way we love, is so unique
And when we touch, I'm shivering
And no one has to get it
Just you and me
Cause we're just living
Between the sheets

I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?

Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops (ooh)
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop

And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine

Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
A feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance (Come on)

I got hustle though, ambition flow inside my DNA

I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head

Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (soldier’s DNA)
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn't have nowhere to stay
At 29, I’ve done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I'm supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gon’ plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say

I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a be-, fuck your life
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the maker of marriages

Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA"

Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

Are we tone deaf?
Keep sweeping it under the mat
Thought we could do better than that
I hope we can
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie

Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm

Turn it up, it's your favorite song

Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

It is my desire
Break down the walls to connect, inspire
Ay, up in your high place, liars
Time is ticking for the empire
The truth they feed is feeble
As so many times before
They greed over the people
They stumbling and fumbling
And we're about to riot
They woke up, they woke up the lions
(Woo!)

Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm

It goes on, and on, and on

In der einen Minute bist du hier, in der Anderen bist du verschwunden
Also respektiere ich dich, will es langsam angehen
Ich brauche eine mentale Rechnung, um diesen Moment überhaupt zu kennen

Stört es dich, wenn ich einen Kuss klaue? (Chop, chop)
Ein kleines Souvenir, kann ich es dir klauen?
Um die Art, wie du mich schockierst, zu speichern
Die Art, wie du es hierher bewegst (Hey)
Möchte es einfach von dir fühlen (Hey)

Hab keine Angst, Gefühle zu entwickeln
Fahr mit offenen Dach und jag Nervenkitzel (Hey)
Ich weiß, dass du hiervor keine Angst hast (Hey)
Baby, ich weiß, dass du keine Angst hast Gefühle zu entwickeln
Gefühle mit mir

Ich bin dein Schaufensterkäufer, ein Abhängiger von deiner Liebe
Schalte von deiner Brille ab, virtuelle (virtuelle) Realität
Es ist nicht, was es dir kostet, es kann ein Dollar sein
Solange es dich schockt, Erinnerung, Elektrizität

Stört es dich, wenn ich einen Kuss klaue? (Chop, chop)

Baby, ich weiß, dass du keine Angst hast Gefühle zu entwickeln (Ungelogen)
Gefühle mit mir (Woah)

Gottverdammt, ich weiß, dass du es liebst einen großen Auftritt hinzulegen
Magst du es bezahlt zu werden oder bezahlte Aufmerksamkeit zu bekommen?
Du hast die falschen Typen mit den richtigen Absichten vertan
Im gleichen Bett, doch es fühlt sich immer noch fern an
Sie sucht nach ein bisschen mehr Beständigkeit
Aber wenn du aufhörst zu suchen, wirst du finden, was sein soll
Und ehrlich gesagt, ich bin viel zu fertig mit Schlampen
Ich schoss meine Exen für deine x und o in die Wüste
Ich hab das Gefühl, dass meine alten Affären mich einfach vorbereitet haben
Wenn ich sage, dass ich dich will, sag es zurück, Parakeet
Flieg in der ersten Klasse durch die Luft, Airbnb
Ich bin der Beste, den du hattest, du würdest mich nur mit mir vergleichen
Ich „at” das an dich, wenn ich dich in meinem Handy speicher
Und lade es hoch, es wird die maximalen Aufrufzahlen bekommen
Ich kam duch das Loch mit den Lippenstiften und Handys rein
Trage dein Lieblingsperfüm, nur um dich alleine zu bekommen

Hab keine Angst, Gefühle zu entwickeln
Hab keine Angst, diese Gefühle zu entwickeln
Fahr mit offenen Dach und jag Nervenkitzel (Yeah)
Ich weiß, dass du hiervor keine Angst hast (Ich weiß)
Baby, ich weiß, dass du keine Angst hast Gefühle zu entwickeln
Woah, woah, woah
Gefühle mit mir

Hab keine Angst, Gefühle zu entwickeln (Nein, nein)
Hab keine Angst, Baby
Fahr mit offenen Dach und jag Nervenkitzel (Woah, okay)
Ich weiß, dass du hiervor keine Angst hast
Ich weiß, ich weiß, ich weiß, ich weiß

Since you know when
Got talked into going out
With hopes you were staying in
I was feeling like myself for the first time
In a long time
'Til I bumped into some of your friends
Over there talkin' to mine

Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talking 'bout us again
If I would've just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house

But you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

Yeah, you hit me Category 5
With your smile
Blew me away
And girl, it ain't but midnight
You done killed the lights
Bent my heart back to your bedside

Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
'Cause I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart storming
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came

I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here, and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free, as birds catchin' the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you

We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spent the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current, as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish, to swim away with the fish
Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

But here I am, next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you
Next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you

Znowu przyszło lato
Ja czekam na stacji
Jest wszystko spoko bo naszły dni wakacji
Czas zrzucić krawat i mieć luz jak Gandhi
Jednego możesz być pewien nigdy nie pożegnam ganji
Ziomek tu podjeżdża zaraz swoim cierpem
Biorę w plecak dużo grassu żeby wrażeń było więcej
Każdy jest już porobiony i podnosi w górę ręce
Nagle zobaczyłem ją
Blond włosy i oczy niebieskie
Jak ją miałem w objęciach to nie chciałem nic więcej
Kiedy tańczyliśmy razem szybciej biło mi serce
Ta plaża to więcej niż miejsce
To wspomnienia i ludzie tak ważni
Powiedz mi Skarbie czy znam Cie jak nikt czy znam Cie jak każdy?
(Hook:Cheat Codes x Demi Lovato)

Nie liczy się teraz już nic oprócz Ciebie
Na koniec świata tylko my we dwoje
Każdy pod wrażeniem kiedy mamy splecione dłonie
I idziemy prosto ku słońcu
Ja chce tylko ją i nikogo innego
Choć wiem że wkurza się gdy widzę moje alter ego
I w dupie mam już ten swój kwit
Uwielbiam z nią być kiedy jesteśmy vis-à-vis
I chciałbym z Nią tu być nie liczyć na farta
Choć jej piękny obraz zasłoniły kłamstwa
I taki właśnie jest sezon letni i bawcie się dużo bez żadnych obietnic

I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me too
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do

'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can

Give me a sign
Take my hand, we'll be fine
Promise I won't let you down
Just know that you don't
Have to do this alone
Promise I'll never let you down

'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight


Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight"
5303,3,Meant to Be,Bebe Rexha featuring Florida Georgia Line,2018,,,,,1,"Baby, lay on back and relax
Kick your pretty feet up on my dash
No need to go nowhere fast
Let's enjoy right here where we at

Who knows where this road is supposed to lead?
We got nothing, but time
As long as you're right here next to me, everything's gonna be alright

If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be
So won't you ride with me, ride with me?
See where this thing goes
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be

I don't mean to be so uptight
But my heart's been hurt a couple times
By a couple guys that didn't treat me right
I ain't gon' lie, ain't gon' lie
'Cause I'm tired of the fake love
Show me what you're made of
Boy, make me believe

Whoa, hold up girl, don't you know you're beautiful?
And it's easy to see

If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be
So won't you ride with me, ride with me?
See where this thing goes
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be

So c'mon, ride with me, ride with me
See where this thing goes
So c'mon, ride with me, ride with me
Baby, if it's meant to be

Maybe we do
Maybe we don't
Maybe we will
Maybe we won't

But if it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be (Sing it, baby)
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be (C'mon)
Baby, just let it be (Let's go)
So won't you ride with me, ride with me?
See where this thing goes (Come for a ride)
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be (Yeah)

If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be"

Yeah I've been searching a map for like any other person who could work it like that
Do it perfectly slow and then perfectly fast and I'm the only one out here and I'm certain of that
Play me a beat it gets turned into ash
If I play you a beat it gets turned into trash
Ayy hold up wait, when I'm on the track I make no mistakes
I can do the shit for like thirty thousand hours
Fuck thirty thousand words I don't slow my breaks
I go UK
Then I make so many pounds everybody think I'm overweight
Getting bread, see me eating
But I gotta go in better hold my plate, oh, oh
Gotta switch up I'm so godly I'm the
Bishop now these haters wanna link up my bars make them get the hiccups oh I had
To run it up real quick freestyle gotta
Do some real shit real quick
Everything I do is real big cuz I gotta
Get a credit dear this real lit real shit
Nowadays they write me another write it
Back see my future demons like it's a psychopath
Like you're gonna suck man so I'm
Driving down the road and I mighty crash
Through the - always moving to know
Where to find ya hey
Moving on gotta find a team or no my
Stripes like a middle but I'm blind
Means all these drivers about to get
Laid there by the readout we keep so
Required I am assigned seats pioneer to
The shit Leif Eriksson I was even hunted
2012 lame jail in these places got me
Season D declared to Nutella fall off
Next year imma be airing it run a little
Shit running ducky in another coming
Down for a hundred bucks and I start all
I wanted was like big dozen hits couple
Couple zeros for the shit's why not look
What I got look what I bought cameras my
True eye on the side cause issues they
Go too high only high tops fuck yeah I'm
The new guy with a my on and company
Smith I'm a motherfucking icon boy too
Cold I don't even on my ice on too late
I don't even have the mic on it up to
Break out and even the lights on better
Way - it's too easy like a layup and my
Fists - entertainers see - no you got to
Stay up taking bets on that I'll fail
It's time to pay up now you're trying to
Hide your face I'm pretty sure that they
Make a I'll drop a head to get a world
Record she's your favorite artist cuz
I'm sure better well maybe not but I
Tried though Post Malone I go psycho
Leave you a stink like a rhino cuz I rat
Be no gyro and I ride fast and our prime
Slowed two miles in the W's tight boat
Hop into the track give you the lovin
You give it right back
Ten different flows I'd be spitting some
Tripe and some other shit get in its get
On a man who done this for like a year
Number Brite is clear how they can I
Respect as that I'm here and I'm here to
Stay did you hear me say I'm not here to
Play he got a flow on a voice now I
Remember when he choking a boy out but
He's back in show no choice now don't
You know that he's gonna destroy now so
I'm gonna get there and I know how to
Cut his beat I'll be blaring so loud
We'll be talking about bitches and money
This shit is so funny my parents are so proud, damn
I'm starting to try trying the shots at
It look at the grind and see stars on
The sky drawing the line all the you right
Beside is here I can see the stars in
Your eyes you're probably high if you
Think that you've compared to me it must
Be part of the lines copying guys you
Better send all those B through the
Future like Marty McFly 30,000 words on
A try little bitch now these people tell
My bit on every yak little bitch nobody
Gotta cut it got a stats little bitch
You giving me a headache where the advil
Bitch but I'm doing all the can and I
Did it in the past tense making all this
Money up for youtube walk me ad sense
Money off for you to buy ad says oh
You're right but the fact I'm a rat then
And I rap huh I'm a laptop
Eminem holds the world record for rap god
1.6 k words though we already have that topped
And we'll do it for another hour
Underrated and I'm under powered my
Bars are so filthy
Oh y'all need to take another shower for
Every fan is a hundred doubters and they
Let me know up in the comments but you
Know that we ain't done cuz I gotta top
My nonsense and I gotta keep it clean do
Exactly what my mom says and I know what
I headed for the top baby still we make
A progress I can spit bars for nine
Months then deliver you a new life yeah
We eating in this bitch Oh y'all better
Take a huge bite and I didn't even write
The shit cuz I freestyle you still like
The shit
See my video press like on it that
Subscribe button better wipe that shit
I'm getting tired of this beat
I think it's time to change it
Cuz I spaz on trap
Oldschool boom-bap you name it
Think of that as an intro now we get
Into the meat of it did some shit you didn't see coming
I don't give a fuck about what you think of it
Hey hey switch up yeah hey hey hey look
Out the window see pastor but with fainter reflections
You never laugh like you
Used to you got Feiner expressions you
Headed down the wrong path innate
Changing the races maybe don't mention
About how I made me a blessing and
Lately I question this shit that was
Taught to me I'm awkwardly stopping
These conversations hey
How long do wait until the day you wake
Up and thank God you made it I don't
Like to dwell but man I gotta say it
Don't let my sons but you still gotta
Play it don't like your road to send up
But you wait dr. Dre stop contemplating
And stop complaining it recreated
Actually don't recreate it be creative
Reach the place where you still vibe in
That shit when we replay it live in
A life of pain just to alleviate it
When you have it use nothing but
Distractions to really take it yeah
Maybe those change when they see we made
It we had it all the new platforms and
Leaving the basics ah my creative
Process is making progress despite my
Background I haven't gone to play in
Lacrosse yet don't you know we got a
Good thing going I been watching all
These shows while I could be showing
I've been creeping up on the doors so
Dangerous you looking at statistics
While I figure how I'm changing them
I don't learn so many things in my past
Life now I don't give a single shit
About the rap life that's nice ain't it
That's nice to be given advice when I
Paint a head twice much the same and I
Can't even comprehend that much in a
Future hey it in the teacher but you
Love in the tutor and to the game I'm a
Fucking intruder stealing these clothes
Man I'm stuck as a loser procrastinating
Cuz my fucking computer no willpower I'm
Just stuck as a loser sitting alone at
3:00 a.m. chillin on a late night is the
Weekdays friend man this shit is too
Wild I must behave Ben that's what the
Teachers are preaching to me but even
When I'm on the top of this drop in the
Rock in the world with confidence
Accomplishments toppling everyone ad
You try stop it obviously the problem is
Solving it just ain't up to me luckily
I've been trained to test the system
Don't you fuck with me I hope you like
My company I hope you do appreciate it
I hope that one day you'll see we made
It no you cannot recreate it although
This pain is just alleviate err I'm just
Trying to find a mindset running to be
The greatest that is why I'm striving
Living trying I'm fine I'm giving
Dignity crying I'm winning but feel like
Dying I'm shining I'm like a diamond but
I'm dead
Inside gets a novel best participant set
It on my big mind and I'm in time
Working on my life get that in line I'm
Trying to figure out everyone get their
Pictures out nobody's gonna live without
This shit on the incline I'm on an
Incline I'm on an incline stay in your
Lane you got your place and I'm in mine
I'm on an incline bitch I'm on that
Incline nobody can really understand how
Much thick climb have I been living yet
Spending time on the Internet I'm
Wasting a hit in it I should be making
The aiming for girls but taking this
Shit instead I stay in bed laughing a
Stupid shit ludicrous who is this
Tangible pendant with two new kids why
Am i doing this why the fuck do I care I
Don't but I kinda do I don't know what I
Tried to do but whatever it is to say
Bye to you hey me I lie to you don't
Realize well it's time you do you have
No idea what I can do when the skies are
Gray you gotta find a blue you gotta try
To do tell them to put you into a new
Positive mindset set headlights go break
Lines kind of deadlines leave lines dead
I guess that I digress aside I just the way I am blessed impressed after I
Impress you seem intent for what I said
But I'm just gonna move on get your
Groove on for my new song do write and
You too wrong at a big head Jimmy
Neutron you try to hate we're getting in
Line just to live with some quick ride
Some straight bugs we've came far but
We're looking up on an incline wanna
Break I got a lot to say it's been 11
Minutes so far I see hasn't been shorter
Can I have a believable man when I live
In a paradise living a luxury nobody
Seen it'll great but what if it's
Different I mean it's assuming there
Being this any conceivable dreaming and
It was so unbelievable being he's
Sucking this river and achievable
Feeling they're giving me something that
Ended up leaving they giving me nothing
I ended up ripping apart inside ended up
Seeing what life could be like from a
Different leading thank God for covers
On so I don't want to wear it to cross
It all over the place I'm surprised I
Haven't lost it yeah hey and I'm feeling
Like I'm at the top I'm living to the
Max now yeah that's how when i'ma say it
That loud I'm stepping up I never back
Down more focus on my background in the
Music and how my rap sound speak up cut
The track down go to the end it on back
Out stuck in the try figure that out
After I'll do the math now it's garbage
Take the trash out but I'm trying to
Stay till I pass out back out okay it's
Time to go faster sit back and relax and
Just maybe you'll get it about number
Maybe your matter said it you can pay
Attention he catch your credit I had to
Let it go back to taking out some layers
In the past that I had to edit never
Back in the middle of the track up let
It mix it up and a few songs but now
Forget it we moved on my pastor agent
Want you to come back and pass a message
Every fact tags and trash you're left to
Cover sucks and sometimes you have to
Edit money you tella am proud I spent it
If I ever have told you I'm a dementia
If you ever feel bad too sad too sad to
Think back to the track in the rap that
Banded yeah pretty ugly some cousin it
Fit this time atop of maybe need to
Television full of little bit Amiga tell
That I ended this voice and more
Powerful than a million instrument study
There was going to look at somebody else
Do you want me to go buddy cut see but
I'm never gonna lever mind Esther be
Better than the people that never had
Trusted me yeah and I'm feeling like I'm
At the top yeah live into the match now
Yeah that's how when i'ma say it that
Loud I'm stepping up never back down
Won't focus on my background in the
Music and how my brat sounds speak up
And a messing with the track now people
Are telling me that I'm falling short
Looking back at you when you're missing
All the cash now and I'm mad at the fact
That I'm not in my right mind meant to
Be a half
They keep on saying though the wrong
Words at a right time look into yourself
You never know what you might finally
Get this guy in the middle of the night
Time I find so much safe I wonder why I
Can't just find mine he's got so many
Confusing questions it's over solid I
Can't use the lessons I'm emerging now
With the new profession i'ma do the best
For my new perfection and I'm doing it
I'm moving on to this future shit these
Hooligans I can pictures of it they just
Don't understand that I am through with
It improving their I'm improving it I
Got my brain and I'm using it and I'ma
Make it out alive when I playing they're
Taking and making it's catching I'm
Tearing these tools to bits you're
Clueless 90% of y'all ignorant keeping
Your mind just a limited get off your
Hands because it is time to figure it
Out see me so close I can picture right
Now success of my drinking I'm sipping
And now and vision and deeper and
Bitches and now my getaway that is a
Limit about God huh my voice is going
Already shit I hey hey hey
Think I've got a consensus being lost in
The trenches adolescent lessons
Expressing cause job as attempt us
Making it hard to stay alive was so easy
To die making you hang your head low
Pass a reach for the skies life is a
Walking contradiction I see it through
Its lies and I'm just trying to tell the
Stories I've seen through its eyes I
Feel enforcing it feed enough reasons to
Cry but though this fake deep bullshit
I'm too eager to try yeah everybody
Sending blessings in need of reply
Trying to sell their own tears for they
Bleed any try fucking demons aside I'm
In need of the wide so I can summarize
My life to my breathing inside like oh
Well I could say that I tried hopped in
The life and then I stayed for the fight
So many beautiful faces but they bacon
Inside and I'm just patiently waiting
For the dead decide damn this reminds me
Of days when I Drive in a lay I'm
Screaming hide to the sky with the smile
On my face now I'm hiding my face I keep
Trying to trace all little steps that I
Take in to find I'm a place just down to
Ocean so lonely ways you're like an
Embrace and now
Mike Leggett said of the Prophet I used
To be an atheist but that turned the
Agnostic recently I've been wonderin if
I fucking lost it you see my friends
From kindergarten go to rehab that's the
Type of shit that makes you think back
To simpler times blissfully ignorant
Minds before reality could proudest we
Would live in the skies and NASA and as
A kid I never thought I'd be being like
This man as a kid I never thought this
Would even exist
I felt elusive intangible des steam in
The mist and now I'm waking up feeling I
And even this shit you've only look at
What you got what you see that it's lost
And life's your gradual for me to
Believe in my sauce don't understand
Rappers bragging I got that paper on me
Man I got kids and schools are doing
Presentations on me so what the fuck you
Believe that you try to take that from
Me to me I'll take that over bullies and
Making some money
Rayna Sonny i'ma do this every day I'll
Study and write these lyrics til my
Brain is fuzzy damn like Ty Lee created
To read such as capital lies these
Romans Halle on my heads with the
Capital eyes there's a natural high I'd
Seen it coming from a farm stop baby
Surprise but I ain't Madison Scotty I
Wrote this album so much hash and I
Actually cried
They say cuz I was never trapped in my
Rack
Is a lie they said cuz I my awkward kid
I'm invalid as DJ Khaled son received
For the platinum plaque for being alive
Do I have for my album it wasn't good
Enough shit I mean it still isn't good
Enough I'm like an active volcano I know
I could've rub but I guess I am not full
Enough damn I swear the higher you get
That's the lower you feel man that's
What shit you gotta do or you won't get
A deal I mean that's what street you
Gotta prove so they know that it's real
30 seconds to listen and thinking you
Know how I feel ya say there's some
Motherfucking thesis statement yeah
Came a long way I cannot be complacent
Every day I wake up stress they have to
Be the greatest and if not an answer dad
Truly feel up wasted most of the
Pressure on my shoulders is coming from
Me so when I die no one like this was
Something to leave so when I wake up in
The morning with something to see yeah I
Got so much said that I'm wanting to be
Benny Ben Benjamin Selena Gomez I said
If you're ready come get it then
Everyone is jealous man you wanna get
Friends with them just in case he is but
I think our iPhone camera lenses to let
The Instagram evidence yeah I know I'm
Way too cocky but I'm working on
Figuring it all out so when people say
You can't that makes you wanna get
Better that's benefit of the doubt
On the top but is never dropping the
Bottom its opposite fun deposit have
Gone from talking often and I'm logged
In a pocket of all my jostling keep
Turning around always stopping my song
Says they keep burning the sound I'm late
Yup this is freedom of speech trying to
Murder all the people who'd be keeping a
Piece it sacrifice your whole life coz
You need a degree opportunity in front
Of you you need to achieve I'm like nah
I'm just trying to find some clarity
Apparently it all has to do with
Popularity there will be obstacles
Primarily people blind into what is
Carefully being prepared for me
Sometimes we'll have 11e paid for the in
Prosperity I'm asking Hillary Clinton to
Marry me too powerful in the very least
Giving you all of my money but never see
Legacy every day than I meant to see
Everyone here is impaired so scary and
Medicine but I know enemy cuz I go
Walking away - block and what Sapna K
Shot in the face gun loggin loaded them
Off at the race drop in the face officer
Place brought in a way predict you what
I will probably say and at the end of
The day still talking a Mesa obviously
Let the audience say so let me explain
This to to those who came in looking at
The state to see an awakened thing these
Famous when they don't understand that I
Take race and I make his from basic
Playlist to the greatest than the team
In the nation be patient was waiting for
Me to break in re-energize the lyrics to
Memorize start an enterprise a better
Guide so can I be successful and never
Try that's my dream job being lazy just
Sitting with the TV on they say that I'm
Right like me on ba I ain't taking
Responsibility pay me for having
With little humidity but whatever I'm
Doing it seems to be killing me I'm a
Willingly artistically fitting into this
History trying to show you one better
But none of you believe me trying to win
This go and try hard good game GG you
Beat me and now you see me in 3d but you
Can't feel me showing up on your device
Control option D Lee consider me part of
Heatley measure myself from retweets
I'll be talking away more chill so you
Can reach me instead of pretending you
Understand what I'm talking about I'm
Sipping you kind of scared for like a
Haunted house trying to show you
Something instead of just sitting on the
Couch I'll be honest now I rarely end up
Walking now into reality getting allowed
To be actually a high belief by myself
Doing nothing you don't laugh at me why
Cuz ideally you would do the same thing
Nothing cos for a brain that is amazing
It's now complaining but the best part
Of life is not even living it love
Sleeping and just using it and never
Much time is limited and I better figure
This perform slipping this opportunity
On my fingertips now let me just tell
You what I came to do trying to show you
Why can rap as fast as I'm able to
Trying to show you why can hop in here
Like a kangaroo and say some stupid
Metaphors and leave out there I'm
Breaking through and if a major record
Label is looking at me I'm a nice guy
With bad teeth got a nice ID for bad
Beats I can't use ride fast their raps
Slow I may make mistakes but everyone
Has so I'm like MJ back when he had the
Afro oh so I'm not black so maybe not
But before everyone gets angry stop I'm
That person they're people naturally
Heymy blood all the people who keep on
Going crazy off because I won't be
Making amazing songs in a mainstream car
A lot of prominent features I'm a
Confident speaker with some dominant
Teachers I deserve to be a starter but
Constantly on the bleachers I'm awfully
Smaller cheaper when I'm up on a spot
And eager baby fearing this every time
That they hear and it don't know that my
Lyrics had a precision of building a
Pyramid so when you live in this please
Let me know when I'm standing here
Frozen please let it go hit  metronome
Combine the compilation to unlock
Superstardom and move all across the
Nation but that it's just a dream and
Probably a combination of a big ego and
False encouragement on the way in but
When I'm playing it just know it's all a
Big game I'm just trying to blow up and
Have a big name but when you think about
It it is all insane working be created
From chemicals in this brain but when
You look at me a lack of respect when
I'm cracking my neck so that I can rap
To my chest cousin of bread some say
That it's magic I step until I'm on the
Same stage that you have it again but so
When you think about the Hall of Fame
You think about a people used to sit and
Call your name and you check and wonder
If it will be artists a step back into
Reality it all remains damn alright I
Just spilled water on my computer right
Now on my computers breaking while I'm
Doing this thirty thousand words shit
Goddamn it
My lyrics are not showing up on a swing
You know when
What I mean this is off the top I don't
Need to use no machines hold up I know I
Can freestyle but I can't do it forever
But I am very clever okay
Okay I'm gonna take a drink if you're
Watching this take a drink - these are
Some shit that you can drink - but drink
Water unless you're of age you know what
I'm saying hey okay okay hey I feel like
I'm Way too different ridiculous most of
Humanity's made of idiots I barely even
Get myself and you thinking you
Understand you think I to be highly
Screen gives you the upper hand please
What I do is barely poetry this hope for
Me I'm noticing people starting to
Notice me but still consider me
Confidence then consider me ready and
Giving out all my flawlessness bye
Honestly all of this is haunting me
Probably it is just a sense of myself
Wobble and toppling into awfully small
Pieces normally all leaving is tragic
And knobs leading it follows me all
Evening it's calling my name it
Constantly makes it so hard to stay away
I close my eyes I let it go and it all
Fades away yeah we're just trying to
Find a great escape to get away from how
We live in life day to day some people
Fight it in a drink or in a cup or in
Some bling or branded drug or any things
That give us love but all I know is that
It's tough and all I know is that the
Stuff isn't enough is way too much I'm
Showing you like this dictator man what
I gotta do to make this quick paper
These kid haters are like 10 years open
Still claim to be big players that shit
Will make me go but I'm aiming
Um and lo got amazing bronze in a crazy
Flow when I may be live but I came to
Show what I can do when I get on a mic
And I'm keeping it moving you sit in the
Hype and I'm seeing it the one success
Inside I don't take it for granted but
Blood to this life selling a romper
Getting a right like 2:00 a.m. in my
Head in the lake head of the bedroom I'm
Living the rest of my golf the bedding
And I get in there like I'll be living
In first class
I know the chena but will surpass gonna
Know worst half for this burn trash
Whenever I work fast
Remember the members they sent in and
Said and again and again and they never
Will ended si de splendor but never but
Legend and every cent as I say is
Perfected take a deep breath cuz I need
That most y'all don't even care what I'm
Saying you really just like our speed
Fast my bars are met I got metal bars
With meta eights and metaphors you want
Better chords and better cars but you
Don't know what I'm heading towards say
That I am the king of the shit crazy
Bronze ain't thinking today some singing
And rapping and making it happen and
Make you laugh while I'm bringing it
Shit trying to find the other way but
Y'all just waiting for another day cuz
What other 14 year old I hit a 100k I'm
Making the most of a crazier flow so
Many ways I can go I'm taking a ton of
You chillin and staying at home I'm
Willing to make it my own
I'm baking my kicky you know that I'm
Eating it even and staying up late is
The need a bit reason to stay in the
Same I just Leonid leaving my life while
I'm seen DC this which really these
People and feeling retreats in a fire
I'm hittin it pleasing these liars and
Peter so never received and agreeing to
Be on the lip and I'm leading it play so
Dope I think it's time that we take a
Break we go make mistakes and pay some
Here I got it always here to save the
Day cuz I am on top of it locked on my
Thoughts and I gotta be stopped in their
Balcony get on my flow and so dominant
Positive confident full of accordions
Compliments all the DS office is born as
Fuck no I am NOT a part of them start a
New person to church and I gotta be
Shuttered its artists aren't and man
When I'm starting it breaking the deck
Like cartilage folks are crazy and up
And you know what I know that you hate
To admit it but really the shit and the
Business variety targeted under
You don't know what's coming I'm coming
Right up in your PIN shutter button I
Funder be part of a little of something
Called living I guess in the art of it I
Try to go slow but it don't work getting
Better and I don't hurt her you think
I'm dead you're so sure you saw DNR
Kosher it slave to the corpse and owners
This is like and love call it Shrek like
The ogre huh bitch I've had enough and
I'm sorry I'm mad enough forgetting to
Wrestle intent and success and I look at
The numbers I add them up my chart is
Like a parabola thank you a lot for
Having us and so every day I take one
Step up man I'm taking a ladder bub
Honey cake he get the plague looking for
And I had it back remember what I have
Said is that we ain't giving up remember
That hit me up when you jump whining
I'll hit you up when I'm done Ronnie
Listen up cuz I'm combining all my
Skills are no one find everyone grind it
You know we do we gotta show that we're
Going through this Larry scope over you
You don't listen so you don't know it's
True cuz we in you know we've done it
Eight thousands that we hunted shout out
To be died and Momo and three others
Should I consider them brothers should I
Consider you all of my families shutters
Do those who will stand with me even my
Older the others abandon me yeah drama
We move past that and I will look at you
With the last laugh better track down
Our breath fast so many skills in my
Backpack started off so terribly now
Only these people compared to me at the
Past I never anticipated what there
Would be and see you so long now after
The end of the song now see you next
Time five hundred and a million it's on
Now it's on now
Oh shit I'm almost out of water this is
A hard disc real challenge it's like
Physically difficult
Hey when I woke up in the scene I hear
Raw Orchestra and everybody telling me I
Don't perform enough
My math teacher told me that I never be
Shit and now I'm search more than their
Quadratic formula I got the formula I
Got the formula you got the sauce but
Goddamn I got a formula a people always
Asking Ben why you record so much I got
A fry-up for these rappers quick like
Order up formula like I missed the crash
I changed and transform it up you stuck
In the past
Yeah our supreme guard goes to my
Science lab first to write the song cuz
I don't like to brag and now tie myself
Up like a Nike mags people let it
Criticize me for the life I had
They make it bout white in black like a
Michael Jack I make these haters looking
Fuse like ass Dora
As summer Swiper brat hey bitch doesn't
Freak I got it on me now they copy down
Like a walkie-talkie and I'm feeling
Like I really wanna stop me trying to
Pull my paper like it's over gum you
Want to justify your hit they call me
Cocky and I am who's it gonna call me
Papi trying to tell you the karate on my
Fashion sheet up and a lot of copies a
Still saying who woulda thought like
What it guest: it having lifted weights
In two years but somehow voice placing
If you really want to find an answer to
Your question here we should look by the
Secret to the side motherfucker better
Go find a cookbook
Hey they die to fuck away the dream
Looking to the stars for some money and
A scheme yeah looking at the cars or the
Hundreds and the grand serpents told you
Know when it's like nothing's as it
Seems god damn I guess I really thought
He was the man I guess I really thought
He had some fans but that shit is all a
Sham all that catchy starters from a
Scam
All the views he got was from some spam
I've been living like man why he been
What he can't why he's just sticking to
The plan how has he been living with no
Limits getting meetings by the minutes I
Don't get it I don't really understand
I've been living like damn he ain't
Getting money by the gram I'll do better
If I study my exams do I really wanna
Stand next to all these average fucking
Sad does so I hate this motherfucker
With a dream cuz he has one yeah
Hey to motherfucker with it dream cuz he
Has one hey just because you gave up
Doesn't mean I'm a backup I feel like
All my good times get replaced by the
Bell once and so they had a muhfucka
With a dream cuz ii cuz i've been living
His patch and i'm in to sit and imagine
I got a picture my life and she listened
To that you've really been digging my
Tracking i'm liver snap
That's inevitable now I'm gonna written
On down I make any minimal way to the
Further reason I'm needing to figure
This out how did I get to the stage I
Don't want to get up and stage to the
Shit every day and I won't give up
Whatever they say let them oppress her
Away but I just can't shoot my shot got
A bad gun so I hate this motherfucker
With a dream cuz he has won by now if
You're still watching this shit you are
A Bochy you deserves some plants for the
Shit but we're over we're done though am
I taking a break
Are you dumb bro well we near and tank
Hey but I'd still need 30k well you sit
Around I will rather work than play
Lyrics go through your dome through your
Vertebrae hit you back and forth till
You end up at the pearly gates now that
She pretty good boy
That's wrote Alec right it's had gonna
Go before it before this hey you know
Just to have some throw stuff in
Sometimes I don't know what to think
Sometimes I don't know what'll make it
Okay it make it okay I'm stubborn oh
They dreams yeah
Hey I wake up on the ridge and my mind
Is wandering all these opportunities
Let's wandered in my oxygen all
Accomplishments left harder than my lack
Of confidence often it's the result of
Falling under consciousness you make
Babies cry I make crazy lives you're
Just angry cause you're living in a
Fading light and I've been feeling this
Energy feeling that somebody's getting a
Penalty fever and I'm under you end up
Ahead of me feeling that this is the
Enemy huh will I tell you no never
I think I'm so clever but in the grand
Scheme of things I know that I'm no
Better but I don't ever wanna go to show
Just one mole
Ramaa go-getter i go get a's and get
Crazy and get AIDS and wake up and get
C's but get paid oh my life is so
Unusual to most it isn't suitable to me
Is irrefutable can see me in a cubicle I
Rather watch my funeral I rather go back
To stab my own brains out back in utero
Uh but you know that I'm capable you
Know I'm a pounce at any chance that is
Available feeling so unique and I think
It's not explainable no one hears my
Lyrics and says OMG relatable no that's
Not what I'm here to give been waited
Years for this year about to experience
Something that I've spent time money and
Thought on learned about all the times
Money had thought wrong kind of funding
It's long gone but time is crummy and on
Long I
I'm not calm not by a long shot out on
The inside see me on the outside I
Always think I'm positive and never see
The downsides it's about time you know
The truth you couldn't be further from
It get your head out your own ass you
Couldn't be further up it okay okay okay
We're like 30 minutes in 30 minutes but
We got thirty thousand bro fuck yeah I'm
The kid in the equation bitch you better
Be where I'm like the e that equals all
Other MC squared I'm just me performing
In front of empty chairs but y'all see
So only y'all better get prepared I got
So much opportunity I gotta make the
Most of issues made of the banana peels
I feel like I'm supposed to slip man and
It's like the old climbing and stable
Lad is it's not about it goes faster but
It's out the man will hold this grip
Damn I got a crazy ass work ethic
Blocked out south east and west leave in
One direction I finished my album and
People saying they love and they fuck
With it but I took it down and redid it
To perfection we go students a rap but
We don't learn lessons like an Eskimos
Jacket or than be furred yeah one
Fuckin unstarted like really bad again I
Didn't even had to ask for me to get her
Bless and that's a horrible bar you
Can't stand me cuz I crossed them up
Their ankles her in yeah uh yeah yeah
I'm an amazing person I base my
Motivation on my favorite angels words
About how I'm gonna make again a famous
Man attains a certain you keep it
Standards low I keep my standards high I
Wanna get on in the action like the
Prizes camera guy can't and I'm fucking
Insane sometimes I fantasize when it
Would be like to be normal if I this
Randomized and analyze my situations
Leaving people paralyzed and take a step
Out of bed hit me while I'm in my
Paradise America's very nice but I like
To see the world but I like to get out
Into the open and meet my girl and a
Mercedes Benz with this lady friends
Crazy Ben is just chilling with them
With me you know they'd be tense they'd
Be tense or more they'd be tense or more
I like to talk to all these people cuz
They marvel at my metaphors it's free
Speech I can say what I want
But these listening are trying to make
Me pay for my time they don't like what
I'm doing they don't appreciate the
Banter I get it get jealous but listen
Cuz I'm the answer
Motherfucker I'm I live for the right
Time fuck that
I'ma live for the moment sitting here in
The middle by the night time my mind
Puzzle with the thoughts that be flowing
Down I've been living in a headache
Bitches never listening it saying that
They ready but I can never believe them
Got these girls and they can never
Achieve them how can your dreams come
True if you ain't one
Damn that's a lot of shit to take about
Suddenly company starts to come to me
Wonder bring what I'm doing my next I
Feel it like that shit I gotta pick a
Route Mason Pitts I gotta get him out
Cut his dreams hell I'm living now in my
Mind's eye given out lots of songs with
Responses that I never pictured Wow damn
Damn
This beast way too holy to rap over
Mental block my minds capacities that's
Love with your raps lower they lack
Closer they lack substance like a
Printer without Tony y'all filling pages
That have nothing oh but I have got
Something to tell you I ain't got some
Money or bullshit to sell you speaking
From late nights I'm thinking the
Drake's like watching these inner who's
Thinking one day I might be on that
Stage right beside all these players
Shit's up to me I won't hide it in
Prayers I'll prove it in the music I
Used to influence I do this to wait
Harder than people assuming resume in my
Writing if you win this lighting that
Puts me to be in the view of the height
And I do what they like and but that
Makes them hate me no matter what I do
They just mistake the reason I'm flowing
The reason I start up not just for the
Fame and the money this dumb person
Damn I talking about the carpet place
Most to these rappers only bright this
Shit using copy/paste I'd have made a
Lot of songs that go to waste I just
Need a homerun I already loaded bass is
I have got so many cases been visiting
Live in in so many places experiences
That I made me
- Emmy then be and please I hope you let
Me be me I ain't greedy or needy believe
Me I just want to be on your TV get on
My level cuz I need a new staircase down
Yeah I've been looking at this face then
One day I'll be there I know what I'm
Doing when I'm already prepared I've
Been waiting like Dirty Dozen tears
Trying to make the world listen so make
Sure that you can hear I'm trying to
Take a passion out of turning my career
I'm concerned without my fear but I'm
Hurting and I'm here now earned it and
I'm here to stay I'm coming in you're
Trying to clear the way another chance
Another fucking here to play not even
1718 I'm so near to fame not really look
At all the shit I just here to stay look
At the future nostalgically I cure every
Disease and y'all still wouldn't be
Proud of me and doubtedly know how to be
What I am about to be to say that money
Talks and that shit seems so damn loud
To me recently I have been feeling
Alienated my songs out of this world
People claim that aliens made I'm a baby
I'm crazy don't hate me don't hate me
Cuz I'm different but hate me because
You hate me then maybe we can live with
That people say that this is the biggest
Thing to hop on the screen all will
Scream overreacting like it's a trauma
Scene y'all are meanest is the best
Quality is honesty promise me that it's
The reality where's Keanu Reeves trapped
In a matrix it's how I felt some time
Back in their ages and I rap on a stage
Does it now elapsed those days are now
Moving on move on why you lose the song
Look for long nothing to see here except
Some stupid pause boo boo Kabam is whole
Place up with one great lung one great
Song
That one great one on vacation I vacate
To a location far away from where people
Just may run a light to go to where
There is no one no one no fun osa I'm
Trying to be me and so young I can
Murder this beat with no gun go one I've
Too many problems to handle here
Hold one I just wander the rat boat but
That ship has no sons and our puns can
Make loud junk
Uptown funk was a great song catchy at
First but the radio station playing and
Making it just get to the boys my head's
Gonna burst if I hear it again and I'm
Sure I'll stall my speakers on the
Ground denting the earth and now I'm
Adding this verse and I mean it now that
Ain't gotta span just keeps on bleeding
Yeah good rappers never get to see the
Light of day but when you sell it sexing
And gimmick the sign in right away
I'll obey now whatever man what is this
I'm read as a fence and a mess and I
Playing my trike so that people will
Know I'm a business nobody witness
Anything better than when I am showing
You did she know I'm suspicious because
I'll be flowing and going like oh this
Kid is big no I live it gonna mission
Y'all better listen til I'm ahead of
This shit by all of the inches yeah and
When I uh I'm telling y'all that I got
It star regarded noise we stopped the
Glory coppers forming an auditory now
Visually typically the original me so
Unforgivable so inexplicable obvious and
Pinnacle digitally damn that was fast
Felt so gentle I unpacked and I'm just
Trying to prove to you the things that I
Can move on the track and I'm trying to
Get a record deal never ever felt so
Real whenever we're the guests to feel
Whenever this gets to feel so different
And I'm loving
Time to change the discovery time to
Make a difference and I'm living it so
I'm up for it I always talk to my mother
Kids their mother kids couldn't
Understand me one path making a nun
Ain't gonna stop for plan B I wrote that
One a long time ago that was the first
Time I look I looked at those again but
You know I started note that rusty not
That rusty I'm actually classic we just
Living in a solar system one big world
Here to hold the visit them
One big dare to control the victims
We're all here trying to find a soul and
Rhythm and a voice or writing a choice
Decided whether or not to follow what
The boys are like and what the girls are
Doing or what we got it'd be exposed to
Think about who you are and it's so true
Think about the people who you think I
Really know you do they really know you
Do you even know you damage it is like a
Jaden Smith tweet sometimes you gotta
Stand out crazy shit B and lately it
Seems to make the extreme so prominent
And dominant and making big dreams
I'm seeing a legion screamed when I go
To sleep man my brain is fixing no I'm
Just trying to make it a life fuck you
To the people who be saying that like I
Ain't making the right he take a
Vacation and hike
I'm chilled out bitches getting famous
Despite the fact that I'm young and a
Little bit nerdy and I know a lot of
People would consider me early I'm just
A little kin working trying to configure
My search is trying to deliver my
Purpose and take a shit on my burdens
I'm just me no my ain't no fake
And I just see all the people living and
Burning so be free try to be a little
Bit nervous it don't matter if he's
Scared cause this shit is disturbing and
I get it and I don't wanna ever forget
It guessing I'm heading towards the
Ending and I know where this flaming so
Well see a brown underachievers hop on
My wagon cuz we're draggin late we gotta
Be leavin man so basically I do this for
Fun and making me I'm trying I'm a black
Girl gone so fast I be getting my career
From A to Z and basically I'm where you
See I made my life at the age of three
But now what am I meant to do what my
Own fan base I hated me I've been
Suppose this using the fans like crooks
Manipulated the Ronnie hands to catch
That hook they'll believe anything that
You tell them like you can feed that
Shit so you could sell your book huh but
No shots fired though nothing wrong with
A little bit of lying though I mean look
At Fox News that's the whole premise in
Their entire show but no political shit
Always do just enough on the minimal
This making the most of my minimum
Twenty I've got a couple is a new
Original bitch I gotta let it drizzle
Prince may your own home dog is a little
Bitch but I feel of the syllables a
Little Brazil because I render bullshit
For the sick kids I got time maybe a
Little too much of it but you know that
I'm trying to move up a bit people look
At me and say my potential has got a big
Man

Mitts underground bless if you
Discovered it though so unique I got so
Much to do don't like any other kid hey
Yo what you say no yeah it's quite I
Could come and spit out of the bait oh
Yeah when I bug out in it then I gotta
Stay low you know I'm coming at them
Shakes like you same boat wait so inhale
The fumes while I paint this picture me
I'm sitting in my room and I'm anxious
Trying to make my most wild a huge any
Famous I knew that to some shit I
Couldn't do I was jaded then somehow I'm
Next up yeah I'm blessed up now I wake
Up and I'm fly I don't dress up now I'm
Flying my opponents better catch up I
Get my check sir

They were right but I tarnish it and
Made a right shit is day and night now I
Gotta take a plate and Vegas might not
Stay the night everybody see me eat and

About to die I think she blocked me on
The Instagram I need to know what that I
Do I guess I missed your plan if me I'm
The searching for the troopers shit
Where is it man I never know just wanted
You to help me understand I need some
Closure because truthfully I give a damn
I gave a damn plenty of fish in the sea
But see I ain't no pleasure man see I'm
A middle man of it man and it means it's
There digging in the sand looking for a
Reason I'm not kidding man
How am I gonna let all of this get him
Even a few much as you texted me chill
Others tell myself I'm a celebrity in a
Way that we could get to me and in the
Didn't matter but right now is feeling
Like everything the more talking about
It against a to remember think about a
Wedding ring but now I'm thinking about
So many things
What did I do to deserve it the shit I
Was pretty a petty things I'll stick
What I'll nothing's perfect like all
Them I let you forget about it and all
That they're gonna set about it but why
The fuck that I get blocked I just kind
Of wrap my head around it I just can't
Wrap my head around it now I'm just
Getting bored I'm just fuckin up all the
Flows just for the fun of it if you're
Still watching this shit comment a
Comment Arrowhead water in the comments
And let me know what would you rate this
Out of 10 give me a rating that way I
Know that you're real they are real one
You know I'm Sam alright wheel
Spectacular speculations having some
Reservations imagining all the
Statements to tribal authorities places
Back an impressive passionate ration of
Reputations that actually don't affect
Some reality left and basis I wish that
We left the nameless associate and more
Faces make judgments from expectations
And watch the heads of shaken people
Want me to crumble and turn to some
Medication to fuck up my motivation and
Focus on education but I'm a petty petty
Petty petty let's are they really ever
To me so many times that you convinced
Me and shit that is so you could have
Won a penny I got a phone in my hand
Like an over the gram and I think I'm
Holding your hair but you don't
Understand I think I'll be the total
Scam you never really know to the end
Like oh this began I'll become in the
Heads of the mansion I forgot more than
A plane how does of the dramas around me
Here follow without like another one
Here by the shit again I guess that's
The way it goes when they stop me and do
Anything to try and stop me I did
Nothing wrong but that's how it goes
When aphasia bitch try to block me
But you stay the same how you expect
Yourself to go take the fan making name
But you don't take the pen you wanna be
Unique but not make it change like what
How you expect to go through this think
About the girls man why you wanna do is
So stupid and useless if you never lose
It with yourself a little for the
Movement when I write the st. the ode to
Joy' this the oldest success don't know
If there is a God but I know that I'm
Blessed and I'm hoping to know and I'm
Open to yes I'll do whatever I can to go
To the best that will go to the right
And go to the left no doubt imma show up
At night instead of going to bed when I
Know that I'm right I'm exploding my
Chest I keep on loading the time and it
Goes over my head I think no why do I
Even try these things I need shiny
Things like diamond rings and flying
Rings and preci bling that is what
Drives these strains I'm so I'm so
Lively and lazy at the same time saying
Something sane and crazy in the same
Rhyme never go to practice who don't
Faze me til it's game time
Learning his life will amaze me how I
Made my define a minute
When a wetland is favorite the mik
Children they get so pissed with me I'm
Either villain now they no kidding and
No I'm not quitting I know I'm just
Sitting sitting with a dream and maybe
Maybe just sit in this city where the
Dream could take me but I know it can't
I know it tastes look I'm angry why I
Just need to be of the a-team at the
Feet of the mainstream man I dream for
This daydream and I believe that I'm
Making it cease for the taking it's me
In a train and I see that I'm breaking
My knees aren't place and I keep on
Thinking that I'm being amazing but I'm
Improving I know it's just a slow climb
Pushing myself yeah I'll be there in no
Time so I'm moving I'm moving till I get
There get where I just don't want to get
Left there I don't remember I don't even
Know what that's from but that was
Written in there it's been a lot of late
Nights okay I don't give a fuck about
Anything skinny white child on a track

Shit his little do you know that I'm not
Afraid of you until I refuse to quit you
Stupid bitch
For real my chick on mass appeal hey
Every Sunday the top is an anthem you
Don't really have to kneel damn restart
You don't have to steal don't like we
Hide the deal damn if I say the teller I
Feel is reeling I've had no drill damn
But Kali we had a deal me to shit ain't
Daffodils damn when the dough comes down
My door can deploy a happy meal hey if
It doesn't have to go never try late
Riser do come and I'm gonna have to
Chill yet it's a new way yelling - Laney
You say you gonna start tomorrow or
Tomorrow - day I get I get all these
Bags stuff a minute suitcase with these
To be spin up clothes like you bunk gang
I accidentally quit out all these lyrics
So I was just trying to piece it
Together like a puzzle you know I'm
Saying hey let's go random shit hey I
Take no credit for anything that I do
But I live life with a positive attitude
That's why I've seen pissed but I'm
Never getting mad at you that's the
Reason that people mirror my attributes
What I contribute to the world is some
Places shit nobody else's world did and
I'm just trying to spread some pieces
Love my man it's really hard cuz you
Need some love I've been waiting cuz
This is defense time for me to be laying
Out of business and I'm breathing in the
Air but it all tastes
When all of this time is wasted really
Ain't wasted this is trash I've done it
When I wrote this I then wrote it's like
2013 this how far back up this how far
Back we are I'm not even I write this
Let's do something else
Oh cuz this I said it's bumping bumping
This beat is just so disgusting you
Leaving me in the lust of my meeting
Grief of my love and I'm enchanted he's
Damn the speed is just full of something
That's making me wanna get up and
Breathe another percussion man I'm
Dancing yeah dancing man I'm feeling the
Rhythm dropping my head fancy snares
That when it hit something really gets
In my bloodstream like just make sense
To me bass and a good groove it's really
A great recipe can't mess with me no
Feeling too good in the moment feeling
New when I go in and feeling blue when
It's over when I'm not a yes and then I
Am applauding next and then I'm trying
To mentally send God attacks like hey
What's up god I don't know if you're
Real but listen to how this box if you
Supposedly feel like a god well you get
What I'm saying and god damn my tap
Police press when I'm paying I said it's
Bumping y'all just go for bride I'm
Feeling good I'm talking every more to
Hide yeah we be feeling and know that
This is the realest shit all the pain
This is killing it love and I'll never
Believe in it it's bumping but leave
This is bumping to me do wave feeling
And so then you just get up you leave
But this is something to me so don't
Come running to me I said we coming in
This shit like will you be fucking a
Dream no never mind probably not but I
Constantly got energy that's lost to my
Thumb
I'm not gonna stop and yet this maybe
Caused them a lot but looking at the end
Result man we've accomplished a lot
And now I'm not gonna regret a thing
After this I'm just trying to master
This cuz right now I'm known as that
Weird eye trapping kid the fact of it is
That it is really just a giant hobby
Something for me to be original not a
Lie copy trying to make a shit you can
Really get your head not inverses so
Fire less when it's done if left
Sobbing it's just a work in progress
Some of my shame is shit and other words
Are nonsense but now we ease it up we
Gotta be this bumpers see me stuntin
While I'm Flo movie it doesn't see me
Bluffing every day and see me bluffing
That is what I do listen to some
Bullshit trying to make a substitute I
Got so much stuff to do when I am just a
Young and to who just hopped on the
Scene everybody one or two but all I
Know is that we find the safety and
Rhythm and that is the reason that I am
Making the same an asset is pompey naira
We're nearing an hour if you're still
Watching the shit I love you I actually
Like love you long time
Okay yeah I'm married to the game but I
Only just better hoping that my chick
Gets better but I'm just gonna move with

Burden is the time limit fuck it I'm

Lifestyle stuff corrupting my with it I
Misunderstood the punchline sighs you're

Corrupting mind with it and how am I
Meant to keep my workflow up if a girl
Shows up on my world blow up I'm just
Sitting and waiting instead of becoming
The greatest trying to find a brand new
Motherfucking deal all you bitches face
All my numbers real all my shit is
Punching in your stomach like a meal and
My marry to the game if I can't afford a
Ring it's a very much the same if I
Can't afford to say now scared for King
Then I said it's scary for King even
They call me odd but I bring even a
Brain reason to believe in you even
Deduct free in a meaning is rarely seen
And no line can be drawn between them I
Don't show seasons yeah I am me no
Matter what and I can grow pleasing I'm
Barely close to anybody I don't know
People man I don't know people do so
People I don't know nobody who doesn't
Own evil man that is a truth and a lie
Truth in a line something like the blue
In the sky was to in a tide yeah I'm new
To this life I moved in my mind dude at
The time man I'm like a proof in
Disguise and all and we're gonna all of
This shit all you should know I'm not
Falling for this you get scourge for one
Minute and
Become an acquaintance I probably get
Richer by focusing left you close minded
Let's open it up and all these people
Assume about what I'll be doing but
They're gonna know when it's up just
Wish that they go away I'm gonna bei
Know what we'll never ever show the way
I'm I will try to mask it up with other
Jokes and fucking jokes always playing
Achieve but now I'm moving on to other
Notes
My voice is fucking and hurting it's
Pretty a lot I know I haven't vocal
Training so I don't know how to do this
For a long period of time without
Causing damage to my vocal cords but who
Gives a fuck man I just delivered up I'm
Gonna go a little bit quieter now uh-huh
Yeah oh look it's people keep on
Changing all of these times and
Different phases all of these lights on
All the stages all the sights are so
Amazing yeah I've seen at least a
Million faces a million times a million
Places felt when it's all said and done
I look and I wonder why everyone knows
That so amazing
Compared to the big people at the
Capitol my name is felt on many cases
People loved me before I made a few
People like the before they watch their
I wanna wait too much one and I haven't
I'm glad because now I'll never stop a
Man on a mission
Teaching of talking a lot of wisdom and
I gotta listen got a following be the
Leader but tomorrow I'll be the teacher
When he need to feature got Blauman said
Him crazy she visited me so amazing I'm
Holding controlling the feeling the
First of the hurts because I am I'm
Later phases in Vinci I know the basics
Already know them I aggravated me while
I'm elated it also we hope we can start
This game and I'm charged up I hate race
But I'm Alma what's behavior so many
People they know the players don't know
The game but don't many majors don't
Know the favorite but we can hear the
Caterer I meet the one proven to show
That I'm Greta I'm here to go move it
Just go on the players it big I'm going
So later I got time my only race I got
Now I'm in I'm on time for the broad
Lines and I'm not crying so let's go and
Let's go
My own people keep calling my phone one
And I know then I'll be the star of the
Show but I'm all on my own
Yeah and I don't want to talk about it
Stop the doubt it because the world is
Awfully crowded but the ghost in me is
Han and the tongue so I'll make it there
All on my own
My inner mission is amazing with
Intermissions and following integration
Conflicting with my decisions and it is
More than the business consists of self
Approval it is to make it look like I'm
Living with something beautiful many sad
But you know is true for most PQ
Appearances is right in front of coal
Just you chabot pursuit of drama moving
To a new type of day that you can gain
From to push away to pass in the places
That you came from day one for me was
Like six months ago
Oh holy shit I actually reached the end
Of the beat but I still have like ten
Thousand more words hold on I got a
Pause this hold on
Three it still want a pass in the places
That you came from day one for me was
Like six months ago
Look at where we've been better matter
But once you go it's not fun to know
That we just live in to die it's not fun
To know that we just live in a die we
Now know how much money you can get for
The line get for the look about how much
You can get for an eye what's the point
Of feeling shit if you just live in the
Cry so get your ass up cause it's time
To make it
Shitty laughing but I practice for my
Passion man yeah either living life all
On my own bitch I ain't start with a
Show bitch I know like four people who
Truly respect your pride and it's
Usually left to climb in a newly
Perfected diamond and if time is money
Then free time it really free and all my
Benefits Kazan lyrics a drilling me
Stemming from a branch of a wish list on
My Christmas tree I wanna be with ton of
Me but sorry gamma meaning me in the
Face of my full potential that is the
Biggest me bigger than you bigger than
Anybody in history the challenge is a
Challenge the fact that you got to
Maximize the satisfy a lavish life I
Have a crazy magic timer luckily I'm so
Damn young cuz man I had the time to
Learn from my mistakes and grow into a
Mastermind I'm trying to master my craft
And the problem is the high guard in
Several different things to potentially
Make my job I want to make the MLS and
Also have a merely subs and also gather
Millie plays and maybe make a big bucks
And maybe young should all be ever
Wanted small really and once I get three
Mil again on my for Millie it's so silly
Is so tricky this whole cycle we can
Never be happy but that is so vital
Those are some builders
Rebirth fee hit the earth my knees hurt
They're weaker than previously her
Breathing seems to be burnt like a three
CDs were before be could be sir sunlight
Please just please work like a lien
Slave owner that's edgy like great snow
So you get me a safe go for the belly
More than a seven-figure who cares about
Flexing if you ain't holding a heavy ah
I've been trying to prove to other
People I knew puddin I like what I do
Discussing like it yet it should go that
He complains and now I'll become true
I'm seeing a bill and it's the reason I
Do other the things that I do it's time
For a cool tougher I gotta redeem and
I've really been needing a clue philony
Shoes fitting these piece and news10 I
Should really get screwed it gives me
The pillars whenever I'm sure down my
Eyes on the doors I don't get a feel for
The finger rinses really please don't
Why the singer must be carrying kids and
Why the say there was a clear vicious
And I get Michele immense AB innocent
That she really is ridiculous and
Magnificently backed up but nobody must
Step it up I didn't see Nicole Madonna's
Coming up okay to the Vatican having
Them good times and bad times new Romans
Do that again when I was when I was so
Young too young to really know fun but
So but I guess that's what happens when
You grow up dry your eyes and wipe your
Nose up just keep drinking till you

Just want to be loved and somehow get
Validated by those we hate such a
Twisted system that we've been given to

Ignorant idiots just can't understand

Can but these ignorant idiots just can't
Understand I got new crews and a new
Friends got new views in the new lens on
The new dude I'm the new bank on my
YouTube but a new trance but the way I'm
Growing is so unorthodox how could I be
Connecting them áfive you had to sort
The dots sort of lost them very found at
The same time a port of cause now I'm
Very loud in a daytime and very quiet at
Night each team is shy when I write and
I'm longing to be a five-year-old
Chillin flying a kite and I admire the
Sight of somebody just working more than
Me I've been staying grounded but the
Sky is moving towards my feet and
Fortunately I'm on course Livermore
Burley grinding to get what's rightfully
Mine I'm headed right for my dream
Damn I guess that's all I needed know
For now they put me in the driver's seat
No way I'm slowing down they know me now
But don't know my son did it so profound
Give me them two years and I'll make it
Let me show you how hey hey hey hey I
Got a stop all of this bragging shit so
Many haters as a mace is the acronym I'm
Trying to get a couple OMGs over WTF he

Music with a different set of ideas he's
Trying to bring my own crib like it's
IKEA here's a protip
No gifts from people who are close yet
Bitch is always so stressed damn cuz

Nation of dreamers who are just trying
To stay awake every day I'd be waking up
To my 8 away stay today hustle I'm just
Trying to pave a way people that have
Colors always get them most advice it's
Like why don't you search your own lif
Don't come closer mind I mostly find it
So please leave me alone - whining next
Time that you're talking shit please
Bring me an open mind cause people
Loggin they own ideas a straitjacket
Some David Blaine's magic you're helping
Your brake pads that I'm trying to raise
- I'm trying to stay savage you're
Trying to make balance while finding a
Great pageant you coming to get up this
Witness an injustice about who people in
Love with the base of a skin color
Snitchin is so dis custody in their
Public I'm trying to make sense of it
Here and it discusses close my eyes and
Go to sleep waiting until they notice me
Wait until my creations I'm making
Everything so complete my thoughts i
Scattered find lots of patterns I try
Not to let akin my plots and ashes I
Don't ever think on some money some
Little talent these rappers shows look
Like lifting battles with Jimmy Fallon
We're really having I'm jealous if
People selling platinum boy see around
My life like saying the words Kendrick
Goblin is way better than average

Incredible magic cube regretable
Attitude is upsetting my passion I'm
Gonna listen to place we're gonna simply
Gaze ajik to commute birth breakouts
Part of my baby minimal break humming

Feelin if I just want to make a pulling
Up I'm putting up with all the amateurs

Done I got green in our beef like a
Omnivore

Bought at stores POTUS knew should they
Still be running more to say that my
Duty is not fair like some mana war I'm
Stuck as well just like the Michelin Man

Can and like a lazy ass beaver I ain't
Giving a damn whoa the shit's corny

Gonna let it slide when the Benjamins do
Adore me and as you guys man it ain't
About fame and fortune we got a greater
Importance that's why awakened I'm born
And I'm trying to play her performance
Hit make a change with a chorus I came
From a tiny clap / nama stage of the
Normans let's do anything to stay out of
Office because I'm cautious it's not
Gonna sell myself for the profits yeah I

Clothes are naked and I do not know

I am with thy pong man

Why not be negligent?
Am I shy?

Hey, why are you here
I do not know
Why can not I Phillip?
Bye, ahhh

It takes one minute for cooking
However, moisture required for muscle proteins
How did we have a salad? They are very aggressive
I know we missed every good customer

Then, closer to draw a cake
Why do you not hide me?
Why are you crazy?
Am I shy?

Hey! Why are you here?
I'm a little stupid
And why should we find the body not in the middle of F?
At the BBC (Oh)

I do not stoop
Check insurance
I do not mind, no
And not my shoes
I want a mouse
Go inside me

Oh Benny, why do you need to take care of me?

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay

Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heart break

You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break

I want all the smoke motherfucker
I want all the smoke
Yeah

As I said, you’re provocative
You was talking shit
And I’m kinda pissed
Lil awkward diss you came with
I cauterize you with the flame quick
Cause I ain’t authorize you to say shit
Them awful rhymes you just pasted
After you copied, your attitude washy
Who the fuck is this rapper dude Bobby?
Bitch look you made a mistake for real
This ain’t a blunt but you’re facing Ls
I hate to tell you, you ain’t got a chance
You’re like 40, still not a man
Who’s this stupid lil bozo?
Man this fool got no flow
I’m not a fan of the rhythm, I eat this fool
Like a sandwich for dinner
This cannibalism, this man is my victim
He’s lacking precision
Watch him get to vanishing quicker
I chop em up like animal liver
Even with sandals I’ll kick you
Need some bandage and stitches
I’m about to have Campbell’s for dinner
Burn my mouth on soup? You ain’t even heard the song I was spoofin’
You smoke trees? I bet all along you’ve been boofin’
Beat me with the bat quick? Nah I’ll hit you with the batman
Gotham style
Yeah cause you’re a fucking joker you moronic clown
Tryna call me out just quiet down
Maybe we can find some common ground
We both rap, but you’re seriously awful pal
Dissing me over a can of soup
Nah damn it dude, what advantage do you have?
That recording was weak, weak as fuck, what mic did you use?
Apple headphones? Yet you claim you freestyled in the booth
I’ll introduce my little truth, you better with comply with the rules
Or I’ll display your head over the fire like a moose
Dragon’s breath? Well bitch I’m a dragon slayer
You look like a washed out chronic masturbator
Thinking you Blaine? You ain’t magic David
All you are is a half assed complacent
Rapper wannabe
Gayhound, huh? Guess you’re full of homophobia
Put this chrome to your dome I’m smoking ya
Bitch dissing young rappers, you’re grown how old are ya?
You’d be better off drinking a cup full of ammonia
Dispatch my diss track on your bitch ass
Can’t withstand the whiplash from my sick raps
It didn’t take me a month to drop, but regardless of this shit
It’s quality over quickness, it’s honestly ridiculous
Like you recorded a wack song and didn’t mix it
Listen, stop with dissin'
Don’t copy my rhythm
I jot with precision
Why the hell you hatin? On my generation?
Cause you live with your mom, stayed in her basement and just never made it
You’re irrelevant nameless, step into danger
A pessimist wasted
This my detrimental creation
Better get him away to
A medical station
What you think I spit slow, I can read cursive fast
And observing facts, this kid’s dyslexic
I murder this fuck in a millisecond
Don’t care where he goes, if it’s hell or heaven
You wanna win? You gonna have to talk even louder
You suck, change my mind like Steven Crowder
You’re scared as fuck and I feast on cowards
You really stink, probably need to shower
I spit that venom, cause I’m symbiotic
Gayhound? You’re the only one in the closet
With your limbs tied and mouth duct taped
For fucks sake, hope you get butt raped
You thought my last track was too long, I’ve shortened it?
That doesn’t mean I didn’t take you to the morgue again
I took this beat and I beat you blue prick
I eat you stupid, I need to do it
This pussy just got raped
Tell him join the me too movement

Pussy die
Look alive
Hit you when I’m cookin rhymes
Crooked spine
I push aside
Wack motherfucker die
Yeah

I'm that evil child

She cut too deep, now she left me scarred (Yeah)
Now there's so many thoughts goin' through my brain (Yeah)
And now I'm takin' these shots like it's Novocaine, yeah

Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

Never caught a feelin' this hard
Harder than the liquor I pour
Tell me you don't want me no more
But I can't let go, everybody told me so
Feelin' like I sold my soul
Devil in the form of a whore
Devil in the form of a whore
You said it, no, you said it
No, you said that shit, we'd be together, oh

Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

Ice keep pourin' and the drink keep flowin'
Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin'
Covered in scars and I can't help showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep rollin'
Ice keep droppin' and the drink keep flowin'
Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin'
All these scars, can't help from showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep blowin', yeah

Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought"

5341,41,Back to You,Selena Gomez,2018,,,,,1,"Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with a cold evenin'
Let a couple years water down how I’m feelin' about you
(Feelin' about you)
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don’t want it
Even though I do (even though I do)

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I’d go back to you

I know I’d go back to you, oh
I know I'd go back to you

We never got it right
Playin’ and replayin' old conversations
Overthinkin' every word and I hate it
'Cause it’s not me ('cause it's not me, 'cause it's not me)
And what's the point in hidin'?
Everybody knows, we got unfinished business
And I'll regret it if I didn't say
This isn't what it could be (isn't what it could be)

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I know I said I wasn't sure
But I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

You can break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
Won't lie, I'd go back to you
You know, my thoughts are runnin' loose
It's just a thing you make me do
And I could fight, but what's the use?
I know I'd go back to you

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

I'll go back to you
I'll go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you, I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
(Go back to you, go back to you)
(Go back to you, go back to you)
(Go back to you, go back to you)"

Woo, made this here with all the ice on in the booth
At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot
(Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 a.m. and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

Some-Some-Some-Someone said
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Pl-Pl-Playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak (Someone said)
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Pl-Pl-Playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak

Yeah, this shit way too formal, y'all know I don’t follow suit
Stacey Dash, most of these girls ain't got a clue
All of these hoes I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my eses, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, ""Hop in, you comin' too""
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that pussy!)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, ""Where we goin'?"" I said, ""The moon""
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose
Who put this shit together? I'm the glue

Someone said
Shorty FaceTimed me out the blue
Someone said
Pl-Playin' for keeps
Someone said, motherfucker—someone said
Don't play us for weak


Yeah!
Astro, yeah, yeah

We got that love, the crazy kind
I am his, and he is mine
In the end, it's him and I, him and I

My '65 speeding up the PCH, a hell of a ride
They don't wanna see us make it, they just wanna divide
2017 Bonnie and Clyde
Wouldn't see the point of living on if one of us died, yeah
Got that kind of style everybody try to rip off
YSL dress under when she takes the mink off
Silk on her body, pull it down and watch it slip off
Ever catch me cheating, she would try to cut my (Ha-ha-ha)
Crazy, but I love her, I could never run from her
Hit it, no rubber never would let no one touch her
Swear we drive each other, man, she be so stubborn
But, what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer?
Intense, this shit, it gets dense
She knows when I'm out of it like she could just sense
If I had a million dollars or was down to ten cents
She'd be down for whatever, never gotta convince (You know?)

Cross my heart, hope to die (Uh)
To my lover, I'd never lie (I love you baby)
He said, ""Be true,"" I swear I'll try

We turn up, mobbin' 'til the end of time
Only one who gets me, I'm a crazy fuckin' Gemini
Remember this for when I die
Everybody dressed in all black, suits and a tie
My funeral will be lit if I-
Ever go down or get caught, or they identify
My bitch was the most solid, nothing to solidify
She would never cheat, you'd never see her with a different guy
Ever tell you different, then it's a lie
See, that's my down bitch, see that's my soldier
She keeps that thang-thang if anyone goes there
Calm and collected, she keeps her composure
And she gon' ride for me until this thing over
We do drugs together (Together), fuck up clubs together (Together)
And we'd both go crazy (Crazy) if we was to sever
You know? We keep mobbin', it's just me and my bitch
Fuck the world, we just gon' keep getting rich, you know?

Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something

Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Keep telling me that it gets better
Does it ever?

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in

No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up

I'm looking through my phone again feeling anxious
Afraid to be alone again, I hate this
I'm trying to find a way to chill, can't breathe, oh
Is there somebody who could...

Reste bien réelle : si je ne t'ai pas, je n'ai rien

Juste pour une nuit, je déconne
Juste pour la vie, ouais, juste pour la vie, ouais

It's Cardi, ayy
Said, ""I'm the shit, they can't fuck with me if they wanted to""
I dont gotta dance

Said, ""Lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to""
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves (ay, ay)
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

Now she say she gon' do what to who? Let's find out and see
Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who in front of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months, what bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, ""Goals,"" bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some BAPE, I might just chill with your boo
I might just feel on your babe, my pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, ""Okay""
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse, I got the trunk in the front
I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill
Think these hoes be mad at me, their baby father run a bill

Said, ""Lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to""
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

If you a pussy, you get popped, you a goofy, you a opp
Don't you come around my way, you can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter is gold, tell that lil' bitch play her role
I just arrove in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott

Said, ""Lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to""

Tenho tatuagens no meu pescoço
Acabei de fazer uma vídeochamada com o Kanye
Falei pra ele que sou seu maior fã

Puta merda, eu tenho uma filha
Ohhh, eu posso cantar tão bem
Me pergunto se eu posso usar a palavra com ""n""?
Espera, eu posso mesmo usar a palavra com ""n""?

Eu estou no corpo do Chris Brown
Eu dirijo a Ferrari dele e sou um negro clarinho

(Ring ring) Que porra é essa?
Eu acordei e sou o Lil Dicky
Ugh, que porra é essa?
Essa merda é muito fraca
Como o pau dele fica pendurado nas bolas desse jeito?
Descendo a rua e ninguém sabe o meu nome
Sem paparazzis tirando fotos, isso é ótimo
Ninguém me julgando por ser negro ou pelo meu passado controverso
Eu vou assistir um filme e relaxar
Ayy, eu sou um Blood mas posso finalmente usar azul
Por que a mãe dele fica ligando o tempo todo?
Me deixa em paz, vadia
Espera, se eu estou no corpo do Dicky, o Breezy é quem?
Espero que minha filha esteja na escola
Porra, se eu fosse o Chris Brown, onde eu estaria?
O que eu faria?

Eu olho pro meu pau mole com gosto, é meu pau dos sonhos

Se eu fosse o Lil Dicky no meu corpo, onde eu estaria?
Eu tô tentando me encontrar como um monge instrospectivo
Eu tô jogando basquete na quadra, meu Deus eu consigo enterrar
Tirei uma foto do meu pinto
Meu pau tá em tendência no twitter? Caralho
Agora eu estou no club, tentei achar um jeito de entrar
Olho na área VIP, minha nossa, lá estou eu
Eu sinalizo pra ele me deixar entrar mas ele não deixa
Eu não sei quem é esse
Espera, que porra ele pensa que ele é?
Peguei uma garrafa de vidro e quebrei na cabeça do segurança
Andei até o filho da puta
Espera, pense por um segundo
Se você me machucar só vai machucar a si mesmo
Mas espera, eu me amo
Esse era o código, agora estamos voltando ao normal

De alguma forma essa merda virou Sexta-Feira Muito Louca
Mas não temos escolha senão virar essa porra do avesso

Sin sentido y sin razón (Sin sentido y sin razón; ah)
Pero tengo un culo nuevo que me da mucho cariño
Y me chinga bien cabrón (Bien cabrón)

No te lo vo'a negar que te sufrí, la pasé mal
Pero te superé y de mi vida te boté (Yo te boté)
Y te di banda y te solté (Y te solté)
Y de ti no quiero saber (Quiero saber)
Y pa'l carajo te mandé, hoy me voy a beber (Me voy a beber)

Ozuna
De mi vida te boté y yo sé que no ere' cualquiera
Me pasaré la vida entera preguntando a dónde fue
Pero tu amiga me textea siempre que ella me desea
Se tira una foto conmigo y me dice: ""Pa' que tú la veas""

Prendo pa' ver si me olvido
De tu nombre, tus beso', tu cuerpo, tus gemido' (Oh)
Lo hacíamo' en el carro, me gritaba al oído
Cierro los ojo' y pienso en todo lo que hicimo', baby (Oh-oh, baby)
Prendo pa' ver si me olvido
De tu nombre, tus beso', tu cuerpo, tus gemido' (Oh-oh)
Lo hacíamo' en el carro, me gritaba al oído
Cierro los ojo' y pienso en todo lo que hicimo', baby (Oh)

¡Nio!
Yo te di confianza y me fallaste
Te burlaste de mí y me humillaste
Lejo' de aquí te fuiste y ni explicaste
Viste mi película y viraste
¿Ahora quiere' saber lo que pienso de ti?
Me siento cabrón porque no estás aquí
Así como viniste tú te puedes ir (Te puedes ir; ¡uh-yeh!)

No te voy a negar que te sufrí, la pasé mal
Pero me superé y de mi vida te boté, y te boté
Te di banda y te solté, yo te solté
Pa'l carajo te mandé, yo te mandé
Y de mi vida te saqué, yo te saqué
Bebé, yo te boté

Miento si digo que no me hace falta cuando me rozaba tu piel
(Rozaba tu piel)
Miento si digo que no me hace falta que llames al amanecer
(Al amanecer)
Pidiéndome que te agarre bien duro en la cama y te haga mi mujer
(Te haga mi mujer)
Aprovecho el remix con Ozu' para mandarte pa'l carajo también
(Carajo también)

No quiero mentira' ni tu falsedad
Me voy pa' la calle esta noche a rumbear
Me bebo dos trago' y te voy a olvidar
Me voy con las babys que quieran jugar
No quiero mentira' ni tu falsedad
Me voy pa' la calle esta noche a rumbear

Worry 'bout who all gives a damn
'Bout where we've been and where we ended up

Ich hab mir Zeit gelassen
Ich fühle mich als hab ich meinen Verstand verloren
Es fühlt sich an als wäre mein Leben nicht meins
Wer kann es verstehen?

Ich will nicht lebendig sein
Ich will nicht lebendig sein
Ich will heute einfach sterben
Ich will einfach sterben
Ich will nicht lebendig sein
Ich will nicht lebendig sein
Ich will einfach sterben
Und lass mich dir sagen warum

All der andere Scheiß, über den ich rede, sie denken sie wissen es
Ich habe gebetet, damit mich jemand rettet, keiner ist heldenhaft
Und mein  Leben bedeutet nichts
Ich weiß es, ich weiß es, ich weiß, dass ich tief in mir verletzt bin, aber kann es nicht zeigen
Ich hatte nie einen Ort, den ich mein Eigen nennen konnte
Ich hatte nie ein Zuhause
Keiner ruft mein Handy an
Wo warst du? Wo bist du? Was geht in dir vor?
Sie sagen jedes Leben ist wertvoll, doch interessiert sich für meins

Ich bin im Tief gewesen
Ich hab mir Zeit gelassen
Ich fühle mich als hab ich meinen Verstand verloren

Ich will, dass du lebendig bist
Ich will, dass du lebendig bist
Du musst heute nicht sterben
Jetzt lass mich dir sagen warum

Es ist der erste Atemzug
Wenn dein Kopf im Wasser untergegangen ist
Und die Leichtheit in der Luft
Wenn du da bist
Brust zu Brust mit einem Geliebten
Es ist Weitermachen, auch wenn der Weg lang ist
Und Licht in den dunkelsten Dingen zu sehen
Und wenn du deine Reflektion anstarrst
Endlich zu wissen wer es ist
Ich weiß, dass du Gott danken wirst, dass du es getan hast

Ich weiß wo du warst, wo du bist, wohin du gehst
Ich wieß, dass du der Grund bist, warum ich ans Leben glaube
Was ist der Tag mit einer kleinen Nacht?
Es kann schwer sein
Es kann so schwer sein
Aber du musst jetzt leben
Du musst jetzt alles geben

Ich bin im Tief gewesen
Ich hab mir Zeit gelassen
Ich fühle mich als hab ich meinen Verstand verloren
Es fühlt sich an als wäre mein Leben nicht meins
Wer kann es verstehen?
Ich bin im Tief gewesen
Ich hab mir Zeit gelassen
Ich fühle mich als hab ich meinen Verstand verloren
Es fühlt sich an als wäre mein Leben nicht meins

Ich will endlich lebendig sein
Ich will endlich lebendig sein
Ich will heute nicht sterben
Ich will nicht sterben
Ich will endlich lebendig sein
Ich will endlich lebendig sein
Ich will nicht sterben
Ich will nicht sterben

Schmerz tut nicht so weh, ich weiß
Die Spur, die ich fahre, fühlt sich einsam an
Aber ich bewege mich bis meine Beine aufgeben
Und ich sehe meine Tränen im Schnee schmelzen
Aber ich will nicht weinen
Ich will nicht mehr weinen
Ich will mich lebendig fühlen
Ich will sogar nicht mehr sterben
Oh ich will nicht
Ich will nicht
Ich will sogar nicht mehr sterben"

I'm upset
Fifty thousand on my head, it's disrespect
So offended that I had to double check
I'ma always take the money over sex
That's why they need me out the way, what you expect?

Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho
Every month
I'm supposed to pay her bills and get her what she want
I still got like seven years of doin' what I want
My dad still got child support from 1991 (One, one, one)
Outta town, people love to pop a lot of shit then come around
Word to Flacko Jodye, he done seen us put it down
Niggas askin' if I'm cool

I'm upset (‘Set, ‘set)
Hunnid thousand on my head, it's disrespect (Disrespect)
So offended that I had to double check

You tryna check?
This is real life, niggas think we playin' chess
So what's next?
Jump up out the bed like I’m possessed
I go out on tour and I say I'm drinkin' less
End up gettin' loose and gettin' pictures from my ex (Ex, ex, ex, ex)
SMS, triple X
That's the only time I ever shoot below the neck (Skrr)
Why you keep on shootin' if you know that nigga dead? (Skrr)
That's the only kind of shit that gets you some respect

Got a lot of blood and it's cold

Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho (Ayy, ayy)

She don't even love me, she just puttin' on a front (front)
She gon' try and settle outta court and make a run
Then gon' ask me how I'm doin'?

Half a million on my head I can accept, yeah
'Least it makes me feel like someone tried their best, yeah
Want to waste a half a million, be my guest
Made me wanna buy a vest and a TEC (Skrr)
But I'm blessed, I just checked (Checked, checked)
Hate me, never met me in the flesh (Flesh)
Said she's got some things she gotta come here and collect
That shit is in a box to the left, to the left (Left, left, left)

Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along

Saw a model on a billboard, 1-800 get to know me
Wondered was she Photoshopped, or were her eyes really that lonely?
Did she leave her hometown thinkin' she'd end up in L.A.?
Did she break down in the desert and get stuck beside the highway?

Get along, on down the road

Sometimes you got to

Cuando yo la vi
Dije, ""Si esa mujer fuera para mí""
Perdóname, te lo tenía que decir

'Tás dura, dura
Dura, dura, dura
Que estás dura, mano arriba porque tú te ves bien
'Tás dura, mamacita, te fuiste de nivel
Dura, mira como brilla tu piel
'Tás dura, dímelo, dímelo, ¿cómo es que e'?
'Tás dura, yo te doy un veinte de diez
'Tás dura, dura, dura

Tú eres la máquina, la máquina de baile
Si no tiene' a nadie vente pa' mi' brazos, caile
Ese perfume se siente en el aire
Algo como Argentina, tú me traes los Buenos Aires
'Tá poderosa, media escandalosa
Habrán muchas mujeres pero tú eres otra cosa
Si fuera un delito eso de que estás hermosa
Te arresto en mi cama y te pongo las esposas
Tienes el toque, toque, toque

Cuál es tu receta no sé, 'tás pa' comerte bien
Me gusta como mueve ese ram-pam-pam

Si me deja, en esa curva le doy pam-pam
Tu belleza retumba, las otras pa' la tumba

Uno, dos y tres, vamo' a darle, la envidia que se calle
Saludos a to'as las nenas que paralizan la calle

Wind up home alone please don't call me
And say you miss me, no

5396,96,One Number Away,Luke Combs,2018,,,,,1,"Are you sitting at home, all alone, trying to fall asleep?
Are you staring a hole through your phone, praying that it rings?
Are you watching a movie that you've seen a thousand times?
Or maybe playing some Mayer, getting lost in your favorite lines

Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice

I’m one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away

Are you stuck at a red light with a Marlboro Light on your lips?
Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss?
Are you changing the station replacing our favorite songs?
Well maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes, I'm moving on

Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To outrun the storm
But I'm almost out that door

And I'm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away

Will you pick up when I call?
Or just forget we loved at all
We don't have to talk
I just wanna hear your voice

And I'm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say

Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
