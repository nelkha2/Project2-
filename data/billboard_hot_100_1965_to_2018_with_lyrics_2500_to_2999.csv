Why do lock yourself up in these chains?
No one can change your life except for you
Don't ever let anyone step all over you
Just open your heart and your mind
Is it really fair to feel this way inside?

Some day somebody's gonna make you want to
Turn around and say goodbye
Until then baby are you going to let them
Hold you down and make you cry
Don't you know?
Don't you know things can change
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day
Can you hold on for one more day
Things'll go your way
Hold on for one more day
You could sustain
Or are you comfortable with the pain?
You've got no one to blame for your unhappiness
You got yourself into your own mess
Lettin' your worries pass you by
Don't you think it's worth your time
To change your mind?

Some day somebody's gonna make you want to
Turn around and say goodbye
Until then baby are you going to let them
Hold you down and make you cry
Don't you know?
Don't you know things can change
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day
Can you hold on for one more day

Hold on for one more day
I know that there is pain
But you hold on for one more day and
Break free the chains

But you hold on for one more day and you
Break free, break from the chains

Turn around and say goodbye

Hold you down and make you cry

Leave the winter on the ground
I wake up lonely
This air of silence
In the bedroom and all around
Touch me now
I close my eyes
And dream away

It must have been love
But it's over now
It must have been good
But I lost it somehow
It must have been love
But it's over now
From the moment we touched
Till the time had run out

Make believing we're together
That I'm sheltered by your heart
But in and outside
I turn to water
Like a teardrop in your palm
And it's a hard
Winter's day
I dream away

It must have been love
(Must have been love)
But it's over now
(It's over now)
It was all that I wanted
Now I'm living without
It must have been love
(Must have been love)

But it's over now
(It's over now)
It's where the water flows
It's where the wind blows


It must have been love
(Must have been love)
But it's over now
(It's over now)
It must have been good
But I lost it somehow
It must have been love
(Must have been love)
But it's over now
(It's over now)
From the moment we touched
Till the time had run out
Yeah, it must have been love
(Must have been love)
But it's over now
(It's over now)
It was all that I wanted
Now I'm living without
It must have been love
But it's over now
It's where the water flows
It's where the wind blows

(Must have been love)
It must have been love
But it's over now
No, no, no"

Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing... I said nothing can take away these blues

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me, guess what he told me?
He said, ""Girl, you better try to have fun no matter what you do,"" but he's a fool

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you


All the flowers that you planted, mama, in the back yard
All died when you went away
I know that living with you, baby, was sometimes hard
But I'm willing to give it another try

Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you"

Oh, yeah, break it down

Girl, I, must (warn you)
I sense something strange in my mind

Situation is (serious)
Let's cure it cause we're running out of time

It's oh, so (beautiful)
Relationships they seem from the start
It's all so (deadly)
When love is not together from the heart

It's drivin' me out of my mind!
That's why it's HARD for me to find
Can't get it out of my head!
Miss her, kiss her, love her
(Wrong move you're dead!)

That girl is (poison)...
Never trust a big butt and smile
That girl is (poison)..

(-caution)
Before I start to meet a fly girl, you know?

Cause in some (portions)
You'll think she's the best thing in the world

She's so - (fly)
She'll drive you right out of your mind
And steal your heart when you're blind
Beware she's schemin', she'll make you think you're dreamin'
YOU'LL fall in love and you'll be screamin', demon, HOO..

Poison, deadly, movin' in slow
Lookin for a mellow fellow like DeVoe
Gettin paid, laid, so better lay low
Schemin on house, money, and the whole show
The low pro ho she'll be cut like an aaa-FRO
See what you're sayin', huh, she's a winner to you
But I know she's a loser (How do you know?)
Me and the crew used to do her!

Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me

Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me

I've realized the dream
And I visualized
The love that came to be
Feel so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that heaven has sent down to me

You treated me kind
Sweet destiny
And I'll be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me
Prayed through the nights
So faithfully
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

I'm just fulfillin' my destiny, yeah!

I told y'all I'm a psycho
Ain't no tellin' what I might do, yeah
Doubt put his hands around my throat, so I cut him off
That's what you get for steppin' on my toes
At the top of the key, that's an iso
My career about to take off, flight mode
You don't like where we're headed, what you sittin' on my flight for, huh?
Yeah, they said, ""Wait until your time comes""
Nope! Time's up
You put in the album, got you thinkin' it's your birthday, woo!
Yeah, I'm full of surprises
A lot of pressure on the records, so you know I'm makin' diamonds
Tell me, how would you define this?
You witnessin' the finest
Yeah, you never know what you can do until you try it, ah!
I been workin' late nights like I'm Letterman
He ain't workin' anymore? Well forget it then
Somebody get the sedatives
Too late, yeah the lightbulb's off in my head again
Where is Edison for my adrenaline?
Rushin' through my veins like it's never did
What good is the body, man, if you ain't got the head with it?

I'm still rhymin', just another day in paradise, Phil Collins
'Til you put your hands on me, yeah, now we got a real problem
Pay homage, make comments
We in the same genre, but I can guarantee we don't put out the same product
Get away from me, there ain't nothing you can say to me
Tried to roll my name through the dirt, that's fine, I was made from it
You ain't made it 'til they printin' shirts with your face on it
Outside tryna sell 'em at your shows, those are fake, dummy
This is something can't nobody ever take from me
No mistakin' me, take a blade to me, take a vein from me
Let me know what you get when you pull the DNA from me, woo!
No matches, I've been the baddest, no way to match it
You never seen the passion that's even half this
I'm wreakin' havoc
I think the fact that you think I'm average is kinda madness
So quit your naggin', you couldn't fathom what I've imagined
Forget the mansion, I'm in the attic
It's pretty graphic, but had to happen
You won't see it, get your glasses, forget the status

Yeah, I feel like we might be on the come-up (all day!)
Knew I was a problem how I showed up (ayy!)
Did not have to sell out, but the show does (all day!)
They ask me why I do it, so I told 'em (yeah!)

I'm just fulfillin' my destiny

I've got an old coat for a pillow, and the earth was last night's bed
I don't know where I'm goin', only God knows where I've been
I'm a devil on the run, a six gun lover, a candle in the wind

When you're brought into this world, they say you're born in sin
Well at least they gave me somethin', I didn't have to steal or have to win
Well they tell me that I'm wanted, yeah, I'm a wanted man
I'm colt in your stable, I'm what Cain was to Abel, Mr. Catch-Me-If-You-Can

I'm goin' down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory
And, Lord, I never drew first, but I drew first blood
I'm no one's son, call me young gun

You ask about my conscience and I offer you my soul
You ask If I'll grow to be a wise man, well I ask if I'll grow old
You ask me if I've known love and what it's like to sing songs in the rain
Well, I've seen love come, I've seen it shot down, I've seen it die in vain

Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
'Cause I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory
Lord, I never drew first but I drew first blood
I'm the devil's son, call me young gun

Each night I go to bed, I pray the Lord my soul to keep
No I ain't lookin' for forgiveness, but before I'm six foot deep
Lord, I gotta ask a favor, and I'll hope you'll understand
'Cause I've lived life to the fullest, let this boy die like a man
Starin' down a bullet, let me make my final stand

Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory
Lord, I never drew first but I drew first blood
And I'm no one's son, call me young gun
I'm a young gun
Young gun

They said you were leavin', someone's swept your heart away
From the look upon your face I see it's true

So tell me all about it, tell me 'bout the plans you're makin'
Oh, then tell me one thing more before I go

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

I'm too proud for cryin', didn't come here to break down
It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end
And how can I blame you when I built my world around
The hope that one day we'd be so much more than friends?

I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming, oh
Even now it's more than I can take

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

Now I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming
Oh, now that your dream has come true

Kat on the rap so mic it
Here's a little story and you're sure to like it
Swift and sly and I'm playing it cool
With my homegirl Paula Abdul
Baby seems we never
Ever agree
You like the movies
And I like T.V
I take things serious
And you take 'em light
I go to bed early
And I party all night
Our friends are sayin'
We ain't gonna last
'Cause I move slowly
And baby I'm fast
I like it quiet
And I love to shout
But when we get together
It just all works out
I take 2 steps forward
I take 2 steps back
We come together
'Cause opposites attract
And you know, it ain't fiction
Just a natural fact
We come together
'Cause opposites attract
Who would've thought
We could be lovers
She makes the bed
And he steals the covers
She likes it neat
And he makes a mess
I take it easy
Baby I get obsessed
She's got the money
And he's always broke
I don't like cigarettes
I like to smoke
Things in common?
There just ain't a one
But when we get together
We have nothin' but fun
I take 2 steps forward
I take 2 steps back
We come together
'Cause opposites attract
And you know, it ain't fiction
Just a natural fact
We come together
'Cause opposites attract
You know it, baby
Nothing in common but this trust
I'm like a minus, she's like a plus
One going up, one coming down
But we seem to land on common ground
When things go wrong we make corrections
To keep things moving in the right direction
Try to fight it but I'm telling you Jack
It's useless: opposites attract
Baby, ain't it something how we lasted this long?
You and me proving everyone wrong
I don't think we'll ever get our differences patched
It don't really matter 'cause we perfectly matched
I take 2 steps forward
I take 2 steps back
We come together
'Cause opposites attract
And you know, it ain't fiction
Just a natural fact
We come together
'Cause opposites attract
2 steps forward
2 steps back
We come together
'Cause opposites attract
And you know, it ain't fiction
Just a natural fact
We come together
'Cause opposites attract
2 steps forward
2 steps back
We come together
'Cause opposites attract
It ain't fiction
You know it's a fact

When he came into sight
Standing by the road
With no umbrella, no coat
So I pulled up along side
And I offered him a ride
He accepted with a smile
So we drove for a while
I didn't ask him his name
This lonely boy in the rain
Fate, tell me it's right
Is this love at first sight?
Please don't make it wrong
Just stay for a night
All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will, you want me too
All I wanna do is make love to you
I got loving arms to hold onto
So we found this hotel
It was a place I knew well
We made magic that night
Oh, he did everything right
He brought the woman out of me
So many times, easily
And in the morning, when he woke
All I left him was a note
I told him I am the flower
You are the seed
We walked in the garden
We planted a tree
Don't try to find me
Please don't you dare
Just live in my memory
You'll always be there
All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
I got loving arms to hold onto
Whoa, oh, we made love
Love like strangers
All night long
We made love
Then it happened one day
We came 'round the same way
You can imagine his surprise
When he saw his own eyes
I said, ""Please, please understand
I'm in love with another man
And what he couldn't give me, oh, whoa
Was the one little thing that you can""
All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
Come on, say you will, you want me too
All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will, baby, want me too
All night long, all night long
All night long, all night long
All I wanna do, all I wanna do
All I wanna do, all I wanna do
All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew"

Miss Brixton queen
Living her life like a bad sweet dream
Telling me lies when the truth was clear
I think she knew what I wanted to hear
Spinning around
Like a wheel on fire
Walking the tightrope on love's highwire
A fatal attraction is where I'm at
There's no escaping me

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

I feel love
When I'm lying in the midnight hour
Holding you's just like a dream
Love is never what it seems
When we touch
And you're holding me the way you feel
Girl, you make my dreams come true
You make my dreams come true

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

She was a Gemini on the cusp of Mars
She holds me back
But she goes too far
Winding me up just to let me down
So emotional
Gagged and bound
There's more to this than meets the eye
A devil woman locked inside
With the formal rising
I was scared
I think I was possesed

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel
I feel love
Everytime your body's next to mine
Somethin' deep inside of me
Wants to love you endlessly
When we touch
Girl, you don't know
How it makes me feel
I just can't believe it's real
I can't believe it's real!
I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

She had an attitude
I can't explain
You never know if your in flame
Tying me up with elastic words
I'm on a countdown till I get hurt
Her blood was hot
She burned so bright
A neon sign there in the night
It's hard to say if I went too far
My heart still bears a scar

I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you
(She was a Jezebel
This bursting queen
Living her life like a bad sweet dream)
Telling me lies
When the truth was clear
I think she knew what I wanted to hear
I just wanna be close to you
(Spinning around like a wheel on fire)
Walkin' the tightrope on love's highwire
A fatal attraction is where I'm at
There's no escaping me
I wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
(I just wanna be close to you, baby)
And show you the way I feel
I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to

Would we've been all right?

Fast on the double
The girl's jazzy
But she's nothing but trouble

You take her where she wants to go
And every day you let her know
She's the one who's always on your mind
But she just got an attitude
Leads you on
Then leaves you blue
Can't you see
She's really just a waste of time
One day
She'll treat you nice
Then she turn as cold as ice
But you think
Your love will win her in the end
Think again

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief
That she's been putting you through
Ooh
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me
I know
I know better than
Better than, better than
Bet, bet better than you

She gets you hot
Then leaves you cold
Keeps you waiting on the phone
Cause she knows
You'll always give her one more try
You're not the only boy in town
And she loves playing to the crowd
But tell me
Do you really like standing in line?
You give her everything you have
And all she does is make you sad
What she really wants to do
Is tell her friends
She did it again


I'd like to say she used to be my girl
But that would be a lie
(That would be a lie)
Cause there's no one
In this whole wide world
That could keep her satisfied I know
Cause I tried

Jump in
One thing I hate
Is when a girl plays fake
And tries to make me late for another date
Cause I've tried to make you mine
For the last time
So take this here as a dis
And a goodbye
She ain't worth it
Even though she's on the high tip
She better get a grip
And get a grip quick
Fast in a hurry
Cause I won't buckle
The girl's jazzy
But she's nothing but trouble

Give her everything you have
And all she does is make you sad
What she really wants to do

Silence fills my room
But in a memory
I hear you calling me
Close my eyes
And I'm there with you
Like it was yesterday
But then it fades away
Take me back
Turn back the hands of time
When you kissed me in the warm September rain
(Warm September rain)
Back before my heart was filled with pain
If only we could be in love that way again
If wishes came true
Then all the dreams at night of love were real
I'd be holding you
If wishes came true
Then I would be that someone
Always special in your heart
And we would still be lovers
Not apart
If wishes came true
Now you're gone
And I'm on my own
Feeling lost inside since you said goodbye
In my dreams
I still feel your touch
Lying next to me
Feeling ecstasy
Take me back
Turn back the hands of time
When you kissed me in the warm September rain
(Warm September rain)
Back before my heart was filled with pain
If only we could be in love that way again
If wishes came true
Then all the dreams at night of love were real
I'd be holding you
If wishes came true
Then I would be that someone
Always special in your heart
And we would still be lovers
Not apart
If wishes came true
I love you madly
I need you badly
Give our love one more chance
If wishes came true
Then all the dreams at night of love were real
I'd be holding you
If wishes came true
Then I would be that someone
Always special in your heart
And we would still be lovers
Not apart
If wishes came truem"

Seems like forever that she's been on my mind
But nothing has changed
She thinks I'm a waste of her time
(There she goes) she don't know what she's missing
Can't she see I'll never give up the fight
I'll do all I can
Till she understands my desire
I've been on the outside looking in
Let me into your heart, oh
There's nothing on earth that should keep us apart
Baby
I can't live without your love and affection
I can't face another night on my own
I'd give up my pride to save me from being alone
'Cause I can't live without your love
Mmm, your love
(So I wait) Here for an answer
And wonder if tomorrow will be like yesterday
I'll keep holding on
Can't go on living this way, baby
I've been on the outside looking in
Bring my tears to an end, oh
I realize there's no use for me to pretend
Oh yeah
I can't live without your love and affection
I can't face another night on my own
I'd give up my pride to save me from being alone
'Cause I can't live without your love
(For your love) I'd put my arms around you
(For your love) I'd find the strength to tell you
(For your love) That I can't live without your
I can't live without your love and affection
I can't face another night on my own
I'd give up my pride to save me from being alone
Baby
I can't live without your love and affection
I just can't go on this way anymore
As hard as I try there's one thing that I know for sure
I can't live without your love
(There she goes)

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight

From the start it's plain to see
You're suffering from a serious broken heart
You know that it's a shame
But I'm here to ease your pain
There's no need for you to feel so all alone
And you and I could seriously be
A sure enough happening thing
Don't you know that---

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight

I can see it in your eyes
You feel the same way, I feel about you
Some call it chemistry
I call it, you should be with me
'Cause I know together we can really turn this mother out
In my mind there is no doubt
That one and one equals me and you
Don't you know that---

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight

I don't believe in fairy tales
But I believe some things were meant to be
Why should we be alone?
When we could have each others arms to hold
'Cause I know together we could really turn this mother out
In my mind there is no doubt
That one and one equals me and you
And don't you know that---

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight

I know your stairs and your doorway
I walk down your street and past your gate
I stand by the light of the four way
And watch them as they fall, oh baby
They all having their heart attacks
They stay at the carnival
But they'll never win you back

Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby

Alright stop, collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
""Will it ever stop?"" Yo I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme, I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle
Dance go rush the speaker that booms
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it you better gangway
You better hit bull's eye the kid don't play
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla

Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in and the Vegas are pumping
Quick to the point to the point no faking
I'm cooking MCs like a pound of bacon
Burning them if you ain't quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin' in my 5.0
With my rag-top down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby waving just to say hi
‚ÄúDid you stop?‚Äù No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
The block was dead
Yo so I continued to A1A Beachfront Avenue
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps acting ill because they're full of eight ball
Gunshots rang out like a bell
I grabbed my nine all I heard were shells
Falling on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene you know what I mean
They passed me up confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla

Take heed 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step
With this.  Shay plays on the fade
Slice like a ninja, cut like a razor blade
So fast, other DJs say ‚ÄúDamn!‚Äù
If my rhyme was a drug I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while D-Shay revolves it

Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla

Yo man, let's get out of here
Word to your mother

Ice ice baby, too cold too cold

I got thoughts, can't control
Got me down, got me low
Rest my mind, rest my soul
When I blow, when I blow
Am I wrong, let them know
Feels so right to let things go
Don't think twice, this is me
This is how I should be

But I'm aggravated without it
My saddest days are without it
My Saturdays are the loudest
I'm blowing strong
Some niggas graduated to powder
I dabble later, I doubt it
My database of narcotics
It's growing long

I wrote this shit to talk about the word addiction
To my niggas --- I hope you listening
--- and ---, I hope you listening
This is for the whole fucking Ville, I hope you're listening
Smoking medical grade, but I ain't got prescription
All the way in Cali where they ain't got precipi-
-tation, feeling like the only one that made it
And I hate it for my niggas 'cause they ain't got ambition
Fuck did you expect, you can blame it on condition
Blame it on crack, you can blame it on the system
Blame it on the fact that 12 got jurisdiction
To ride around in neighborhoods that they ain't ever lived in
Blame it on the strain that you feel when daddy missing
Blame it on Trump shit, blame it on Clinton
Blame it on trap music and the politicians
Or the fact that every black boy wanna be Pippen
But they only got 12 slots on the Pistons
Blame it on the rain, Milli Vanilli with the disk skip
What I'm tryna say is the blame can go deep as seas
Just to blame 'em all I would need like twenty CD's
There's all sorts of trauma from drama that children see
Type of shit that normally would call for therapy
But you know just how it go in our community
Keep that shit inside it don't matter how hard it be
Fast forward, them kids is grown and they blowing trees
And popping pills due to chronic anxiety
I been saw the problem but stay silent 'cause I ain't Jesus
This ain't no trial if you desire go higher please
But fuck that now I'm older I love you 'cause you my friend
Without the drugs I want you be comfortable in your skin
I know you so I know you still keep a lot of shit in
You running from yourself and you buying product again
I know you say it helps and no I'm not trying to offend
But I know depression and drug addiction don't blend
Reality distorts and then you get lost in the wind
And I done seen the combo take niggas off the deep end
One thing about your demons they bound to catch up one day
I'd rather see you stand up and face them than run away
I understand this message is not the coolest to say
But if you down to try it I know of a better way

I'm just gon' cruise down the road
Look at the stars in the sky
And drift off into the sweet memories that I have
Of a love that my heart has been searching for
For so long, and I know somewhere
If I keep looking, that love I'll find
The picture grows clearer and clearer
From the back to the front of my mind
And like love, a love I know I'll have
The girl that I want, she'll be mine, she'll be fly, and it'll last
I see her face and I can't let go
She's in my dreams and my heart, so let me know
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
I'm looking for that love
She's a thought and a vision in my memory
I haven't met her, but tell me where could she be
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
I'm looking for that special love
(love, oh love, love is a feeling that I need)
Love is a feeling that the Hammer definetly needs
(please be mine)
Baby be mine
(I need your love to make it)
I need your love to make it
So why don't you be mine
The search is going on
From coast to coast
A women for the man, who's propping the most
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
My heart is beating strong
This love cannot be wrong
I need her and I want her, so come on to my home
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
I'm a keep looking
At the movies, in my car, on my stereo
At a game of Different World or the Cosby Show
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
Yo veo, tell me what's up
At the track, at the club, or out buying dub
If you've seen her, then I'll have her, cause I'm in love
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
My heart is hurting so bad
(love, oh love, love is a feeling that I need)
Love is a feeling that I know I need
(please be mine)
Be mine baby
(I need your love to make it)
I need your love to make it
Why don't you be mine
(baby, be mine)
Where could she be?
At the store around the corner
Or wondering at night
Or chilling with another brother holding the mic
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
Hammer, you know I'm looking
Calling all my friends all around the place
Guy, Levert, or my homey Rob Base
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
If you've peeped her out, tell me
Yo, veo on the phone
Ted, Dre, or Ed Lover
Fab Five, homeys won't you help a young brother
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
I got a picture in my mind
The thought is so clear of the love I need here
Like D-B magic, and why don't you appear
(have you seen her?)
Oh baby, why don't you appear
(tell me have you seen her?)
I can see yo' face
I'm seeing her face, again and again
Come knocking at my door, and you know I'll let you in
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
Oh, my sweet love
Searching 'round the world, what more can I say?
The girl is hard to see like an unseen VJ
(have you seen her? tell me have you seen her? have you seen her?)"

Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers
This is the year of the hungry man, whose place is in the past
Hand in hand with ignorance and legitimate excuses
The rich declare themselves poor, and most of us are not sure
If we have too much, but we'll take our chances
'Cause god's stopped keeping score
I guess somewhere along the way he must have let us all out to play
Turned his back, and all god's children crept out the back door
And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much, much too late
Well maybe we should all be praying for time
These are the days of the empty hand, oh you hold on to what you can
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year
This is the year of the guilty man, your television takes a stand
And you find that what was over there is over here
So you scream from behind your door
Say ""What's mine is mine and not yours""
I may have too much but i'll take my chances
'Cause god's stopped keeping score
And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That he can't come back
'Cause he has no children to come back for
It's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much too late
So maybe we should all be praying for time"

You know people are funny sometimes

And feelings we'll never find

Let 'em know, that you're too much
And this is a beat, uh, they can't touch

Yo, I told you (can't touch this)
Why you standin' there, man? (You can't touch this)
Yo, sound the bell, school's in, sucka (You can't touch this)

Give me a song, or rhythm
Makin' 'em sweat, that's what I'm givin' 'em
Now, they know
You talkin' 'bout the Hammer, you're talkin' 'bout a show
That's hyped, and tight
Singers are sweatin', so pass them a wipe
Or a tape, to learn
What's it gonna take in the 90's to burn
The charts? Legit
Either work hard or you might as well quit

That's word because you know (You can't touch this)
(You can't touch this)
Break it down!

Stop, Hammer time!

Go with the flow, it is said
That if you can't groove to this then you probably are dead
So wave yo hands in the air
Bust a few moves, run your fingers through your hair
This is it, for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Move, slide your rump
Just for a minute let's all do the bump
(Bump, bump, bump)

Yeah (You can't touch this)
Look, man (You can't touch this)
You better get hype, boy, because you know you can't (You can't touch this)
Ring the bell, school's back in
Break it down!

Stop, Hammer time!

You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
Break it down!

Stop, Hammer time!

Every time you see me, the Hammer's just so hyped
I'm dope on the floor and I'm magic on the mic
Now why would I ever stop doin' this?
With others makin' records that just don't hit
I've toured around the world, from London to the Bay
It's ""Hammer, go Hammer, MC Hammer, yo Hammer""
And the rest can go and play
You can't touch this

You can't touch this
You can't touch this
Yeah (You can't touch this)
I told you (Can't touch this)
Too hot (Can't touch this)
Yo, we outta here (Can't touch this)"

Scheming, planning lies to get what you need
So full of promises that you never keep

Sick and tired of all of your games
And you want me to stay, ah, better change

I drink up all the Hennessy ya got on ya shelf
So just let me introduce myself
My name is Humpty, pronounced with a ""umpty""
Yo ladies, oh how I like to funk thee
And all the rappers in the top ten--please allow me to bump thee
I'm steppin' tall, y'all, and just like Humpty Dumpty
You're gonna fall when the stereos pump me
I like to rhyme, I like my beats funky
I'm spunky. I like my oatmeal lumpy
I'm sick wit dis, straight gangsta mack
But sometimes I get ridiculous
I'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice
Hey yo fat girl, c'mere--are ya ticklish?
Yeah, I called ya fat; look at me, I'm skinny
It never stopped me from getting busy
I'm a freak, I like the girls with the boom
I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom
I'm crazy, allow me to amaze thee
They say I'm ugly but it just don't faze me
I'm still getting in the girls' pants
And I even got my own dance

The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

People say ""Yo, Humpty, you're really funny lookin'""
That's all right cause I get things cookin'
Ya stare, ya glare, ya constantly try to compare me
But ya can't get near me
I give 'em more, see, and on the floor, B
All the girls they adore me
Oh yes, ladies, I'm really being sincere
Cause in a 69 my humpty nose will tickle ya rear
My nose is big, uh-uh I'm not ashamed
Big like a pickle, I'm still getting paid
I get laid by the ladies, ya know I'm in charge
Both how I'm living and my nose is large
I get stupid, I shoot an arrow like Cupid
I use a word that don't mean nothing, like looptid
I sang on ""Doowutchalike"", and if ya missed it
I'm the one who said, ""Just grab 'im in the biscuits""
Also told ya that I like to bite
Well, yeah, I guess it's obvious, I also like to write
All ya had to do was give Humpty a chance
And now I'm gonna do my dance

The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

Oh, yeah, that's the break, y'all
Let me hear a little bit of that bass groove right here
Oh, yeah!
Now that I told ya a little bit about myself
Let me tell ya a little bit about this dance
It's real easy to do--check it out

First I limp to the side like my leg was broken
Shaking and twitching kinda like I was smoking
Crazy wack funky
People say 'ya look like M.C. Hammer on crack, Humpty'
That's all right cause my body's in motion
It's supposed to look like a fit or a convulsion
Anyone can play this game
This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name
No two people will do it the same
Ya got it down when ya appear to be in pain
Humping, funking, jumping
Jig around, shaking ya rump
And when a doo-doo chump punk points a finger like a stump
Tell him step off, I'm doing the Hump

The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Black people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
White people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Puerto Ricans, do the Humpty Hump, just keep on doing the hump
Samoans, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Let's get stoopid!

The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Oh, yeah, come on and break it down

Once again, the Underground is in the house
I'd like to send a shout out to the whole world
Keep on doing the Humpty Dance
And to the ladies
Peace, and Humptiness forever"

And why you keep dissing me
Poor little me
And why you have a change of heart
Then turn it all around
And then try to put it on me
Poor little me
But don't you know
I can be a trip
I can make things hard
But baby I believe that you still got a heart
That's why I try to stop myself before I start
'Cause I can make it tough
I can make it rough
But I won't

I'm giving you a minute to try to work it on out

Work it on out

Baby, how could you be hanging out on the town
And claim that you're missing me
Poor little me
When you knew all the time
That you could've been with your homegirl
Loving and a kissing on me
Sweet little me
But don't you know
If you wanna be a man
You gotta work real hard
If you wanna make me feel like I'm your number one
And nothing in the world should make us part
'Cause we can make it work
If you take away the hurt from the heart


(Oh) I can be a trip
But I choose not to
(Oh, oh) Deep inside of you
I think there's still good in you, boy

(Oh, oh) Just take the benefit
Don't give me no lip
And I'll be sweet to you

I wanna give it, I'm giving you the benefit
I wanna give it, I'm giving you the benefit (woo)

And wished ever after would be like this
You said ""I love you babe,"" without a sound
I said I'd give my life for just one kiss
I'd live for your smile and die for your kiss

Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sands - I remember you
And through the sleepless nights, through every endless day
I'd wanna hear you say - I remember you, oh

We've had our share of hard times, but that's the price we paid
And through it all we kept the promise that we made
I swear you'll never be lonely

We woke up to the sound of pouring rain
Washed away a dream of you
But nothing else could ever take you away
'Cause you'll always be my dream come true
Oh, my darling, I love you

Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sands - I remember you
Through the sleepless nights, through every endless day
I'd wanna hear you say - I remember you
Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sands - I remember you
Through the sleepless nights, through every endless day
I'd wanna hear you say - I remember, I remember you, yeah"

All alone
Trembling hearts
Beating strong
Reaching out
Breathless kiss

And feel your lips are touching mine
Baby, when you're close to me
I want you more each time

There's nothing I can do
I'm helpless in your arms
Oh, baby what you do

This is it
There's no turning back this time
No, no, no
Here we are
Once again
But this time we're only friends
Funny world sometimes lies
Become the game
When loves the prize
And though no one knows
What's going on inside
And all the love I feel for you
Is something I should hide
When I have you close to me
The feeling's so sublime
But there's nothing I can do
To keep from loving you
No, no, no
Can't keep from loving you, baby
No, no, no
There's nothing I can do my baby
Can't keep from loving you"

I can't escape the pain inside
Because love takes time

I don't wanna be here alone

Losing my mind
From this hollow in my heart
Suddenly, I'm so incomplete
Lord, I need you now
Tell me how to stop the rain
Tears are falling down endlessly

You might say that you don't care
You might say you don't miss me
You don't need me

Maybe it's only tonight

Until the heart in you is starting to break?

Leaving the scene of the crime

Coming apart at the seams
Eager to please, ready to fight

There'd be trouble at home
'Cause we never talk a lot
When we spend time alone
So how are we supposed to know
Know when something is wrong
Well, we've got a way to communicate
It keeps a happy home

And no one does it like me
And no one but you
Has that kind of whip appeal on me

Keep on whippin' on me
Work it on me
Whip all your sweet sweet lovin' on me
Keep on whippin' on me
Work it on me
Whip all your sweet sweet lovin' on me

When we go to work
How the day seems so long
The only thing I think about
Can't wait 'til we get home
'Cause we got a way of talking
And it's better than words
It's the strangest kind of relationship
Oh, but with us it always works

And no one does it like me
And no one but you
Has that kind of whip appeal on me

Whatever you want (whatever you want babe)
It's alright with me (it's alright with me)
'Cause you've got that whip appeal
So work it on me
It's better than love
Sweet as can be
You've got that whip appeal
So whip it on me (baby)

Keep on whippin' on me
Work it on me
Whip all your sweet sweet lovin' on me
Keep on whippin' on me
Work it on me

C'mon And Get My Love
D-Mob Introducing Cathy Dennis
Written by D. Poku
C'mon & get my love, c'mon and get my love it's for you
Break it down
So many times I've been around you
And I know how much I like you
It's like a dream each time I see you
And there's this magic in the air
I feel so shy that I can't approach you
Even though you're just there
But I know that one day I'll get my way
And this is what I'll say
C'mon and get my love, c'mon and get my love it's for you
C'mon and get my love, c'mon and get my love it's for you
And in my dreams I am with you
And I dance with your silhouette
There are many times I've tried to squeeze you
In these dreams I won't forget
It seems so long we've been together
Since way back then
And only if you knew how much I loved you
You'd turn to me and say.....
Let's just say that our love is right
Would you kiss and hold me tight
Cos I want to hold you and squeeze you
And tell you that I love you
Each and every night
Let's just say that our love is strong
Would you know were you belong
Or would I have to show you and teach you
Hold you and please you to show you that you belong
C'mon & get my love, c'mon & get my love it's for you
C'mon & get my love, c'mon & get my love it's for you
If there's been a time that I needed you
Then the time is now
I want to see you every hour
When I think I always hear you say....
C'mon & get my love, c'mon & get my love it's for you
C'mon & get my love, c'mon & get my love it's for you
Repeat Rap.....
Chorus & fade"

Than the way they are today

Uh, I don't know it's... It's just a thing with me you know
If I see somethin' that I like, it's a... I have to go for it
And I like what I see, baby
Ah, come here

I got real bored on a friday night, I couldn't find a damn thing to do
So I pulled out a suit about the same color as my BMW
I drove to the party and I stepped on in, just to see what I could see
Everybody knew what I was lookin' for
I was lookin' for some company, that's right!

Jerk out
Jerkin' everything in sight
And you know that I'm talkin' about the...
Jerk out
(I got the cash, I got the ride, Oh Lawd)
Got to make some love tonight
And you know I got the look

I saw a real fine thing sittin' by the bar
She looked kinda all alone
So I slid on over and I asked her name
The Stella was bad to the bone
I showed her my stash and I kissed her cheek
The only kind of rap it takes
She knew I was bad when I jerked her to my ride
She said, ""How much money you make?""
Let's just say it'll be more money...

Jerk out
(...Than you'll ever see in your lifetime, ha ha!)
Jerkin' everything in sight
I'm talkin' about the...

Jerk it, jerk it
Jerk out
Jerk it, jerk it
I'm talkin' about the
Jerk it, jerk it
Jerk out

I took her to my crib and I laid her down
Her body felt kinda right
Maybe I was wrong but what the hell, I figured that was what she liked
I said ""Baby, don't get too comfortable, 'cause I really like to sleep alone
Leave your number on the table by my data bank. I love you, but you got to go""
(What?)

Jerk out
(You ain't got to go home, but you got to get the hell outta here)

But a year to make love she wanted you to wait?
Let me tell ya a story of my situation
I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation
The way that I met her was on tour, at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got on stage, drippin', pourin' with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met
I whispered in her ear, ""Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if you are a hundred proof""
I asked her her name, she said: ""Blah-blah-blah""
She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said: ""How do you like the show?"" She said: ""I was very amused""
I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked, ""Do ya have a man?"", she tried to pretend
She said: ""No, I don't, I only have a friend""
Come on!
I'm not even goin' for it, this is what I'm goin' sing

You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time
I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
'Cause I have friends and that's a fact
Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jack
Forget about that, let's go into the story
About a girl named ""blah-blah-blah"" that adored me
So we started talkin', gettin' familiar
Spendin' a lot of time, so we can build up
A relationship or some understanding
How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
After this was established, everything was cool
The tour was over and she went back to school
I called every day to see how she was doin'
Every time that I called her, it seemed somethin' was brewin'
I called her room, a guy picked up, but then I called again
I say: ""Yo, who was that?"" ""Oh, he's just a friend""
Don't gimme that, don't even gimme that!
Jus' bust this

You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

So, I came to her college on a surprise visit
To see my girl, that was so exquisite
It was a school day, I knew she was there
The first semester of the school year
I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
This guy made me fill out a visitor's form
He told me where it was and I was on my way
To see my baby doll, I was happy to say
I arrived in front of the dormitory
""Yo, could you tell me where is door three?""
They showed me where it was for the moment
I didn't know I was in for such an event
So, I came to her room and opened the door
Oh, snap! Guess what I saw?
A fella tongue-kissin' my girl in her mouth
I was so in shock, my heart went down south
So please, listen to the message that I send
Don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend..."

Resulta ser, hey, you were at a party
Higher than the sky, emborrachada de Bacard√≠
(No, I wasn't)
I bet you didn't know que conoc√≠ al cantinero
(What?)
He told me you were drinking and wasting my dinero
Talking about come and enjoy what a woman gives an hombre
(But first of all, see, I have to know your nombre)
Now I really wanna ask ya, que si es verdad
(Would I lie?)
And please, por favor, tell me la verdad
Because I really need to know, yeah necesito entender
If you're gonna be a player, or be my mujer
‚ÄòCause right now you're just a liar, a straight mentirosa
(Who, me?)
Today ya tell me something, y ma√±ana es otra cosa

Ain't got nobody, baby...baby

I remember the day que t√∫ me dec√≠as
Time and time again que t√∫ me quer√≠as
(I do!)
And at the time, hey, yo te cre√≠a
Porque no sab√≠a that you were a relamb√≠a
Yo y Fulanito y Menganito, Joseito y Fernandito
Larry and Joey y then his brother Chico
(Uh-uh)
Mucho que frentera, that's a straight skeezer
Si quieres un pedacito, go her way ‚Äòcause she's a pleaser
But I tell ya straight up porque, brother, me di de cuenta
That on Main Street her cuerpo estaba a la venta
Now get some man que quiera get some cualquiera
Hey, yo, she don't care man, she's a tremenda fiera
Yeah you're hot to trot and out to get what I got
Pero ya que te conozco, what I gots? I guess not

‚ÄòCause you‚Äôre just a mentirosa con tu lengua venenosa
Today you tell me something, y ma√±ana es otra cosa

Girl, I can't believe it

Ella no sab√≠a that, yo, I knew her plan
De que iba a salir with that other man
So I told the girl in Spanish, I said ""Hey, ya me voy.""

2600,100,Tic-Tac-Toe,Kyper,1990,tictactoe,kyper,,,1,"Tic Tac Toe is a game I used to play
When I was little I used to say
I got the X and I got the O
It don't matter cause it's Tic-Tac--Toe
Now I'm a little bit older
I like to play just a little bit bolder
I like gettin' girls and givin' em pearls
And their legs across my shoulders
I love to go to the disco
See a fly girl and say hello
They just look me in the eye and pass right by
With that booty shakin' like Jello
I like to speak cause that's bein' nice
It makes me mad when I have to speak twice
But that's the game that girls like to play
It's just Tic-Tac-Toe and roll the other way

X, and O. As in yes, and no
X, and O. As in sex, maybe so
X is for yes and O is for no
X is for sex or maybe so
You might get some if you play this game
All girls love it but smooth is their game

That's why they just walk right by
Laughin', gigglin', shakin' that pie
Girls are what you what when you come up to them
So don't play dumb and try to school em
That's when you got to be real cool
Jump in the biz and act a fool
Pull out the portable car phone
Next thing you know you'll be drivin' em home
On the way there you're thinkin' bout one thing
Girls ain't dumb they know you want the wild thing
You through the X and go for the kiss
They throw the O and go for the dis

Do you wanna play Tic-Tac-Toe?


I met this girl by the name of Judy
Kind of cute with a real nice booty
Hard to get and likes to play tough
Cause she knows I want the funky stuff
When I spoke, she wouldn't even speak
Til she saw me in the biz that week
Took her to the movies and bought her a treat
Went to my house and made the bed squeak
Yeah that Judy puts up a fight
But I won with the X cause I rolled that night
Just when things started to feel good
We rolled a little fast and we broke the wood
My dad got up cause he heard some knockin'
Thought it was a crook me and Judy was rockin'
Came to my room opened up the door
Son whatcha doin'?
Playin Tic-Tac-Toe"

After all is said and done
Only emptiness inside us
Baby, look what we've become
We can make a million promises
But we still won't change
It isn't right to stay together
When you only bring each other pain

I don't wanna cry, don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul
(Given you my heart and soul)
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry

Too far apart to bridge the distance
But something keeps us hanging on and on
Pretending not to know the difference
Denying what we had is gone
Every moment we're together
It's just breaking me down
I know we swore it was forever
But it hurts too much to stay around

I don't wanna cry, don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul
(Given you my heart and soul)
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry, no, no

All the magic's gone
There's just a shadow of a memory
Something just went wrong
We can't go on make-believing
On make-believing

'Cause I don't wanna cry, don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul
(Given you my heart and soul)
Said I've given you my heart and soul
(Given you my heart and soul)
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry, cry
I don't wanna cry

Consider this the slip that brought me to my knees, failed
What if all these fantasies come flailing around?

Everything I needed
I feel in your eyes
Always thought of keeping
Your heart next to mine
But now that seems so far away
Don't know how love could leave
Without a trace
Where do silent hearts go

Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go?

Candle in the water, drifting helplessly
Hiding from the thunder
Come and rescue me
Driven by hunger
Of the endless dream
I'm searching for the hand that I can hold
I'm reaching for the arms that let me know
Where do silent hearts go

Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go?

Then one touch overcomes the silence
Love still survives
Two hearts needing one another
Give me wings to fly

Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go?

I've got someone to give my heart to
Feel it getting stronger and stronger
And stronger
And I feel inside

Hearts are made to last
Until the end of time"

Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

Here it is the groove slightly transformed
Just a bit of a break from the norm
Just a little somethin' to break the monotony
Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be
A little bit out of control it's cool to dance
But what about the groove that soothes that moves romance
Give me a soft subtle mix
And if ain't broke then don't try to fix it
And think of the summers of the past
Adjust the bass and let the Alpine blast
Pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme
And put your car on cruise and lay back 'cause this is summertime

Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

School is out and it's a sort of a buzz
But back then I didn't really know what it was
But now I see what have of this
The way that people respond to summer madness
The weather is hot and girls are dressin' less
And checkin' out the fellas to tell 'em who's best
Riding around in your Jeep or your Benzos
Or in your Nissan sittin' on Lorenzos
Back in Philly we be out in the park
A place called the Plateau is where everybody goes
Guys out huntin' and girls doin' likewise
Honkin' at the honey in front of you with the light eyes
She turn around to see what you beepin' at
It's like the summer's a natural aphrodisiac
And with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme
To hip you and to get you equipped for the summertime

Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

It's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet
Hustle to the mall to get me a short set
Yeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair
Cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there
The temperature's about 88
Hop in the water plug just for old times sake
Break to ya crib change your clothes once more
Cause you're invited to a barbecue that's startin' at 4
Sittin' with your friends cause y'all reminisce
About the days growin' up and the first person you kiss
And as I think back makes me wonder how
The smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia
All the kids playin' out front
Little boys messin' round with the girls playing double-dutch
While the DJ's spinnin' a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion
Then six o'clock rolls around
You just finished wipin' your car down
It's time to cruise so you go to the summertime hangout
It looks like a car show
Everybody come lookin' real fine
Fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon
Every moment frontin' and maxin'
Chillin' in the car they spent all day waxin'
Leanin' to the side but you can't speed through
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
There's an air of love and of happiness
And this is the Fresh Prince's new definition of summer madness
 repeated till it fade out
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind"

Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change

The world is closing in
And did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers?
The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change

Walking down the street
And distant memories
Are buried in the past forever
I follow the Moskva
And down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change

The wind of change blows straight
Into the face of time
Like a storm wind that will ring
The freedom bell for peace of mind
Let your balalaika sing
What my guitar wants to sing


Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change"
2640,40,P.A.S.S.I.O.N.,Rythm Syndicate,1991,passion,rythm syndicate,,,1,"Sitting in my bedroom
The rain is pouring down
The shade is on the window
And loneliness is all around
A little voice I'm hearing says
Don't you stay inside
But I can't fight this feeling got L.U.S.T. on my mind
I head for the arena where lovers try their fate
Moving through the darkness
I take my place and wait
A pretty bird beside me says hello with her eyes
She looks so sweet and lovely
But is she N.A.S.T.Y?
P.A.S.S.I.O.N
Got me in a jam again
There's no way that I can win
P.A.S.S.I.O.N
Her lips are calling to me
No way I can resist
Addicted to the feeling
Intoxicated by her kiss
I take her to my castle
We set our bodies free
And while the music played on
She loved me down from A to Z
The night is getting longer
I start to realize
Don't know what I've got into the girl is C.R.A.Z.Y
I try to cool the fire like I oughta should
But there's no way to turn back
The S.E.X. is just too good
P.A.S.S.I.O.N
Got me in a jam again
There's no way that I can win
P.A.S.S.I.O.N
Don't be tempted to touch the fire
I should've read all the warning signs
You might get burned by your own desire
I lost my mind
I must have been blind
I never knew another lover that was evil under cover
Then I discovered you, girl
You're like no other
Doing the time for the crime
I was blind
To the games that you were playing
Words that you were saying
Going out of my mind
You're like a hurricane
Drive me insane you're like a heart attack
Know it's a fact
You got the knack to drop a man to his knees
P.A.S.S.I.O.N
Got me in a jam again
There's no way that I can win
P.A.S.S.I.O.N"

Down in the gutter, life is slipping away
Let me still exist, in another place
Running under cover of a helicopter blade

Burning down the bridges of my memory

Where they're downing only deer, a hundred steel towns away

Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words, ""I love you"" rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam
For I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailing

Photographs and kerosene
Light up my darkness
Light it up! Light it up!
I can still feel the touch
Of your thin blue jeans
Running down the alley, I've got my eyes all over you, baby
Oh, baby

Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words, ""I love you"" rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam
For I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailing
I'll be sailing
I'll be sailing
I will

Oh, I've got lightning in my veins
Shifting like the handle of a slot machine
Love may still exist in another place
I'm just yanking back the handle
No expression on my face

Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words, ""I love you"" rolling off my tongue

We push in on the book and it magically flips open to the first page: a drawing of small Papa Elf in his wonderful work shop.
INT. PAPA ELF'S WORKSHOP - NORTH POLE - DAY
PULL OUT FROM THE BOOK TO REVEAL
The real life Elf and Workshop of the drawing we have just seen. PAPA ELF, 540 years old or roughly 55 in human years, is surrounded by scores of strange and specific tools and some scattered half-built toys.
PAPA ELF
So you're here for the story? Okay. Just let me wet my whistle.
He pours himself a shot of milk in a snow-flake shot glass and downs it.
PAPA ELF
(like it's liquor)
Whoo! That's strong! Must be two percent! Elves love to tell stories, you probably didn't know that, did you? Well, there's a lot of things about us that people don't know. For instance, we can't tell a lie. It's physiologically impossible. Here's another interesting Elf-ism: There are three jobs available to an Elf. You can make shoes at night while an old cobbler sleeps...but it's not exactly the most rewarding work.
QUICK CUT AWAY TO
Two ELVES hammering away at a pile of shoes as a fat shoemaker sleeps with a copy of ""Hot Cobbler"" magazine on his chest, a busty cobbler lady on the cover.
DISGRUNTLED COBBLER ELF
Lazy bastard couldn't even make a flip-flop...
EXT. ELF TREE - DAY
The exterior of a tree, we hear cooking going on inside.
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
...you can bake cookies in a tree. But it's dangerous having an oven in an oak during dry season...
We hear a yelp and now a siren rings and then the TREE BURSTS INTO FLAMES, ELVES SCURRYING OUT.
INT. PAPA ELF'S WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
PAPA ELF
But the third job. Well, the third job makes being an Elf worthwhile. Some call it ""the show"" or the ""big dance"". It's the profession every Elf aspires to. And that's to build toys in Santa's workshop.
CUT TO:
A TRACKING SHOT OF SANTA'S WORKSHOP
The CAMERA whips by a crowd of bustling elves building dolls, toy horses, action figures, squirt guns...everything. There's even a row of X-boxes being assembled.
PAPA ELF
It's a job only an Elf can do. Our nimble fingers, natural cheer and active minds are perfect for toy building. They've tried using Gnomes or Trolls but the Gnomes drank too much and the Trolls weren't toilet trained.
CUT AWAY:
1) A drunk GNOME, stein in hand, vomiting below the table. 2) A TROLL wearing a diaper is chewed out by an Elf cleaning up the floor.
PAPA ELF
And no human could ever do this work. Their hands are too big and they tend to get testy when over worked. In fact, no human has ever set foot in Santa's workshop. That is until about thirty years ago. And in case you haven't guessed it, that's our story. It was back in 1968. A particularly successful Christmas...
INT. ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
A Christmas tree flickers. A nurse changes a giggling ten month-old BABY's diaper.
NURSE
You're quite a giggler, aren't you?
(lying him down)
Well, it's time for night-night.
She tucks the baby in and exits.
NURSE
(as she leaves)
Merry Christmas, my angel.
CLOSE ON
The Rocking Crib. The BABY rises, giggling. His eyes light up as he stands, holding the gate of the crib.
Santa's black boots drop in from the chimney. The baby shakes the gate. Quickly, Santa moves to the Christmas tree, where he lays out presents. There is an OFF-SCREEN CLANG! Santa LOOKS UP and sees the empty crib. The gate is down:
BABY'S POV
He gleefully skitters across the floor towards a large, fuzzy teddy bear in SANTA'S BIG RED BAG.
FADE TO:
INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP
A bevy of ELVES with slightly larger 60's Elf collars and sideburns celebrate another successful Christmas. Several elves start CHANTING for a speech. SANTA, seated in his rocker, stands to applause. Merrily, he gestures for quiet.
SANTA
Alright, alright...Well, we've had another successful year. Prancer was able to control his bladder over Baltimore, and we didn't forget Delaware...
A party HORN blows. LAUGHTER. Santa cheerfully pats down with his hands for quiet.
SANTA
And now after a lot of hard work it's time for a vacation, starting now!
Santa looks at his watch as five seconds click off. The elves all rest their heads on their elbows.
SANTA
Alright! Vacation's over! Back to work! Time to start preparations for next Christmas.
The elves cheer and get back to work. When an OFF-SCREEN COOING is heard.
SANTA
What in the name of Sam Hill...?
More COOING. Perplexed, Santa looks down to his bag just as a human baby, dressed only in a diaper, crawls out and smiles.
Silence. The elves stare in awe at the strange visitor. An ELF looks on the back of his diaper and sees the brand name ""Little Buddy Diapers"".
ELF TWIN #2
It's name is Buddy. He must've...
ELF TWIN #1
...snuck into your sack at the orphanage. What do we do, Santa?
Santa looks befuddled.
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
Santa had a decision to make. But fortunately when it comes to babies, Santa's a push over. So Buddy would stay with an older Elf who had always wanted a child, but had been so committed to building toys, he had forgotten to settle down. Yes, Buddy was raised by me, his adopted father. My, how I love that boy.
MONTAGE: BUDDY GROWING UP AS AN ELF
A giant baby is wedged into an extra-tiny crib.
Super 8 home movie of Papa Elf holding a two-year old baby that is almost as big as he is.
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
Tough Buddy grew twice as fast, he wasn't any different from the other little elves. I mean, not really...
Video Footage: of 7-year old Buddy riding a really small tricycle around in circles at a birthday party with a laughing Elf child on his back and another Elf under his arm.
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
And though it is against the Code of Elves to lie, all agreed that until Buddy asked us, no one was going to bring up the fact that he was actually a human being.
A series of Polaroid photos showing Buddy, 12, dunking a basketball over three elves.
Buddy in Elf school, wedged in a tiny desk. The ELF TEACHER is pointing to the black board where ""THE CODE OF ELVES"" is written.
ELF TEACHER
And before we learn how to build the latest in extreme graphic chipset processors, let's recite the Code of the Elves, shall we? Number one?
ELF STUDENTS
TREAT EVERY DAY LIKE CHRISTMAS!
ELF TEACHER
Number two?
ELF STUDENTS
THERE'S ROOM FOR EVERYONE ON THE NICE LIST!
ELF TEACHER
Number three?
We push in on Buddy as he recites...
BUDDY & EVERYONE
THE BEST WAY TO SPREAD CHRISTMAS CHEER IS SINGING LOUD FOR ALL TO HEAR!
EXT. ELF HOCKEY POND - CURRENT DAY - DAY
An ANNOUNCER ELF is on a megahorn, doing play by play of an elf hockey team...
ANNOUNCER
(on megaphone)
Lum Lum across the line, feeds it to Foom Foom, behind the net, looking, feeds Blinky...Wait! Rimpo-correction, Wombo. I think...and - uh-oh! - here comes BUDDY!
QUICK CUTS
A smiling Buddy pounds tiny elves into the boards with brute force. The elves are helpless. Buddy finishes this off with a wicked slap-shot.
ANNOUNCER
(like an elf Pat Foley)
He SCOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORES! And it's 14-zero with eleven minutes left in the first period.
INT. ELF LOCKER ROOM - DAY
Post game, Buddy's in the locker room. Elves congratulate him and occasionally reach up to slap him on the butt.
POM POM
Good game, Buddy.
BUDDY
Thanks! Sorry about your shoulder, Pom Pom!
POM POM
No sweat. It's just a collar bone!
They're all tossing their jock straps in the bin. Little Elf jocks land, and then a HUGE ONE, proportionately the size of a large serving tray. It's Buddy's.
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
But as much as Buddy was accepted by his friends and family, there were drawbacks to being a human in an elves' world.
RAPID FIRE:
A dozen shots of Buddy slamming his face into doorways, beams, cabinets. These shots look shockingly painful.
BUDDY
Ow...jeez...yikes...golly...charles dickens! Sone of a nutcracker!
INT. PAPA ELF'S WORKSHOP - DAY
The FINALE: Buddy attempts to put a star on top of the semi-tall Elf Christmas tree.
But Buddy's pointy Elf slipper gets hung up in an ornament.
The elves step back, preparing for the inevitable: Buddy panics, wiggles his leg and pulls the tree over on top of him, falling into the fire place and engulfing in flames.
Pom Pom sprays him with a mini-fire extinguisher.
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
And no where were Buddy's differences more obvious than in Santa's toy shop.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP - NORTH POLE - DAY
We see an assembly line of elves making Etch-a-sketches with wooden hammers. We pan finally to Buddy as an ELF SUPERVISOR APPROACHES.
BUDDY
Gee, I'm sorry, Ming-Ming. I'm gonna come in a little short on my quota today.
ELF SUPERVISOR
It's okay, Buddy. How many Etcha-Sketches did you get finished?
Buddy is about to answer. But then his face winces up. FIGHTING BACK TEARS.
ELF SUPERVISOR
How many, Buddy? It's okay, you can tell me.
Clearly tearing up now, Buddy sets his tiny wooden hammer to the side and reveals a box of his toys.
BUDDY
I only made...
(crying)
Eighty-five.
Eighty-five? He might as well have said zero. The elves all look at each other.
ELF SUPERVISOR
Oh, don't worry about it Buddy. This is a great start! You're only 915 off pace.
BUDDY
Oh, why don't you just say it Ming Ming?! I'm the worst toy maker in the whole world! I'm a cotton-head ninny-muggins!
ELF SUPERVISOR
Oh, you're not a cotton-head ninny muggins! We all have different talents, that's all.
BUDDY
Actually, it seems like everyone has the same talents. Except for me.
ELF SUPERVISOR
That's not true, you have lots of talents. Special talents. Like, uh...
Supervisor Elf looks around to the other Elves for back up. They try to chime in.
ELF #1
You changed the batteries in the fire alarm!
ELF #2
(absurdly positive)
You sure did! Triple A's! And in six months, you'll need to check 'em again! Won't he!
(everyone agrees)
ELF #3
And you're the only baritone in the Elf choir. Without you, we'd sound like a bunch of...I mean, you bring us down a whole octave!
ELF #1
In a good way!
ELF SUPERVISOR
See? You're not a cotton-head ninny muggins. You're Ex-traordinary!
BUDDY
Well, you know what? I'm sick of being extraordinary!
Upset, Buddy struggles to get his thighs out from under his desk, and now runs off, tagging his head on the door frame.
INT. PAPA'S WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
Buddy storms into his tiny house. Papa Elf looks up from his work, surprised. Buddy can't speak. He runs over and locks himself in the bathroom.
INT. ELF BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
This bathroom is ABSURDLY SMALL, Buddy squeezes in like Harry Houdini. The toilet is the size of a Big Gulp cup. Buddy sits on it and starts to sob. Washing his face in the tiny sink.
KNOCK KNOCK.
We INTERCUT with Papa Elf at the door.
PAPA ELF
Son? Are you okay?
BUDDY
Go away!
PAPA ELF
(shocked)
Buddy!
BUDDY
I'm sorry, papa. May I please have some Buddy time?
PAPA ELF
Open up, son. I think we need to talk.
The door finally creeks open, revealing a funny wide shot of him squeezed into this box of a room. He wiggles out. Still wiggling.
PAPA ELF
Come sit with your papa.
Papa sits on the couch, Buddy sits on Papa Elf's knee. Papa winces.
PAPA ELF
Alright, let's hear it.
BUDDY
Well, everyone knows you're Santa's Master Tinker. And Grandpapa was Master Tinker before you. And great Grandpapa before ye. I'm supposed to follow in your footsteps...but I'm always letting everyone down.
PAPA ELF
Well, there's something I should probably tell you, Buddy. And it's long over due...
(intense beat)
You see...um...
BUDDY
What is it, Papa?
Papa Elf looks into Buddy's beautifully innocent eyes. He can't bring himself to do it.
PAPA ELF
(changing the subject)
I need your help on something.
(adjusting Buddy's weight)
Up up now, nice and -- ow, OW!... There we are.
Papa Elf leads Buddy through a door to reveal the most amazing sight Buddy has ever beheld.
SANTA'S SLEIGH
A GLOW emanates from the hand-rubbed, red-lacquered wood chassis, illuminating the entire room.
BUDDY
Wow. Santa's sleigh!
(hesitates)
Can I touch it?
PAPA ELF
Touch it? You're going to help me make it fly, Buddy.
BUDDY
I thought the magical reindeer made the sleigh fly.
PAPA ELF
And where do the reindeers get their magic from?
BUDDY
Christmas spirit. Everyone knows that.
PAPA ELF
Yes, but unfortunately, Christmas Spirit is becoming a very limited resource.
BUDDY
What do you mean?
PAPA ELF
(hard to break the news)
Well, Buddy, as silly as it sounds, there are a lot of people down South who don't believe in Santa Claus.
BUDDY
(shocked)
What? Who do they think puts all their toys under the tree?
PAPA ELF
There's a rumor floating around that parents are putting them there.
BUDDY
That's ridiculous! There's no way parents could do that all in one night! And what about Santa's cookies!? I suppose parents eat them too?
PAPA ELF
I know...but every year less and less people are believing in Santa, and today we've got a real energy crisis on our hands. See how low the Claus-o-meter is?
We see a gauge on the instrument panel of the sleigh with CHRISTMAS SPIRIT LEVELS written and a needle resting in the DANGEROUSLY LOW red section.
PAPA ELF
That's why I installed this little baby back in the sixties.
Papa pushes a RED BUTTON, causing a JET ENGINE to shudder with a high-pitched whir. Buddy is amazed.
BUDDY
Oh my Gosh!
PAPA ELF
Watch the language son.
BUDDY
Forgive me, Papa. What's that?
PAPA ELF
A Viper turbojet with 358 cubic meters of displacement, high volume air intake and customized spark timing.
(off Buddy's look)
I know, it's a little less magical, but everyone's still getting their wish, that's the important thing, right?
(around him)
Listen, the motor mounts are giving me some wiggle. Do you want to give the ol' man a hand?
BUDDY
(coming around)
Do I?!
And just like that, father and son hunker down and tinker together.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP - TOY TESTING - THE NEXT DAY
We push past a tiny door marked TESTING. Elves everywhere are testing toys. Buddy stands in front of a conveyor belt pushing Jack in the Boxes past him. He turns the crank producing the 'POP GOES THE WEASEL' tune and a puppet pops out scaring him every time. POP!
BUDDY
Ahh!
Another one: POP!
BUDDY
UHHHH!
This one doesn't pop for a beat and then: POP!
BUDDY
(biggest one yet)
AHHHH!!
(to supervisor)
I'm going to take five, okay Krumpet?
KRUMPET
Okay!
We follow Buddy as he approaches an Elf kitchenette. But before he enters, he stops, over-hearing a few Elves drinking cider and talking behind his back.
FOOM FOOM
...and that EX-traordinary bit! That was quick thinking.
ELF SUPERVISOR
Hey, I feel bad for the guy. I just hope he doesn't get wise.
FOOM FOOM
Hey, he's believed he was a real Elf for this long, hasn't he?
WE SLAM INTO A CLOSE UP OF BUDDY'S SHOCKED FACE
QUICK SERIES OF FLASHBACKS FROM BUDDY'S PAST flash before his eyes not unlike 'the sixth sense'.
AT THE SHOEMAKER: Buddy is painfully squeezing into new shoes.
IN BED: Buddy tosses and turns - three beds have been pushed together to make a human twin-sized bed.
IN THE ELF SHOWERS: Buddy is struggling to wash under a three-foot high shower head.
THE ELF CHOIR PHOTO: Only Buddy's waist is visible, he's cropped out.
An exact replay of those rapid-fire shots of Buddy slamming his head into doorways, beams, cabinets.
BUDDY
Ow...jeez...yikes...golly...charles...Dickens! Sone of a Nutcracker!
IN THE FACTORY: tinkering with a Ken Doll, Buddy moves the arms like his arms.
BACK ON BUDDY, queasy. His head spins as the CAMERA CIRCLES HIM. The room spins. Buddy's knees go weak.
Pom Pom hurries over, concerned.
POM POM
You don't look so good, Buddy. Are you okay?
Buddy tries to speak, but instead COLLAPSES RIGHT ON TOP OF POM POM, crushing him beneath his weight.
POM POM
(muffled under Buddy)
I'm okay, Buddy. Don't worry about a thing. I'm warm.
INT. PAPA'S WORKSHOP - TEN MINUTES LATER
Buddy wakes up from his sleep to find himself in Papa's workshop. FOCUS RACKS to Papa tending to his son.
BUDDY
Ooooooh. I had a terrible nightmare.
PAPA ELF
What is it, Buddy?
BUDDY
I dreamt I wasn't an Elf at all. I was a human. Oh, it was awful. I'm not a human, am I Papa?
PAPA ELF
I knew this day would come. You see, Buddy, I love you and nothing can ever change that. But the fact is, it wasn't a dream. You're not like the rest of us.
BUDDY
You mean I'm not an Elf?
PAPA ELF
No, son, you're a human being.
BUDDY
No wonder I'm always freezing!
PAPA ELF
We decided it was best to let you think you were one of us.
BUDDY
But I thought elves can't lie.
PAPA ELF
We can't. But Buddy, you never asked! I thought for sure when you cracked six feet it would come up.
BUDDY
(getting upset)
I thought I had a glandular problem.
PAPA ELF
Your glands are fine.
BUDDY
(emotional)
So, you're not my Papa?
PAPA ELF
Oh, I'll always be your Papa. It's just you have another Papa, too. A biological Papa.
Papa Elf opens a drawer and shows Buddy a photo: a young couple are in love...
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
I then proceeded to tell Buddy of how his father had fallen in love when he was very young with a beautiful girl named Susan Welles, and how Buddy was born and put up for adoption by his mother. And how she had later passed away. I told him his father had never even known Buddy was born. And most importantly, I told him where his Dad was: in a magical land called New York City.
Papa Elf puts a snow globe in front of Buddy showing the Empire State Building with a sign NEW YORK CITY.
BUDDY
Uhh! I feel confused and sweaty! I need some Buddy time!
Buddy runs off.
PAPA ELF
Buddy?! Buddy?!!
EXT. NORTH POLE - MINUTES LATER
Buddy runs and runs. He passes some ANIMATED ANIMALS, a RABBIT, a RACCOON and a SQUIRREL.
RACCOON
Hey, Buddy! Want to sing and pick snow berries?
BUDDY
Not now Pipsy!!
He passes by an ANIMATED SNOWMAN in the front yard of a toasty little cottage.
JIM THE SNOWMAN
(a faint whisper)
Oooohhh! Buddy...
BUDDY
Hi, Jim. What's wrong?
JIM THE SNOWMAN
(very quietly)
Uh, ow. Sorry...my back's out of line again. Do you mind cracking it for me again?
BUDDY
Sure, Jim.
Buddy comes from behind him, squeezes and then we hear a CRACK.
JIM THE SNOWMAN
(speaking at full volume)
Ohhh, thank you, Buddy. That's soooo good. It's from all the standing. They never build me sitting down. Hey? Why the long face?
BUDDY
Well, Jim. It seems I'm...I'm not an Elf.
JIM THE SNOWMAN
Of course you're not. You're six-three and had a beard when you were fifteen.
BUDDY
Papa says my real father is living in a magical place far away.
JIM THE SNOWMAN
At least you have a father. I was just rolled up one day. I never had anyone to play catch with. And even if I did. I only have sticks for arms.
BUDDY
I guess I am pretty lucky after all.
JIM THE SNOWMAN
I bet your dad would be so happy to see you, he'd hug you and never let go. I wish I had a dad to hug. And even if I did, I only have sticks for arms.
BUDDY
I understand about your arms, Jim.
JIM THE SNOWMAN
Well, you should do all the things I can't. Go see him. Hug him. And play catch. And scratch your ass.
BUDDY
I will. I'm gonna go find my dad!
INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP - THE NEXT DAY
A triumphant swell of music as Buddy walks through the workshop for the last time. Each Elf he passes says goodbye.
BUDDY
Bye Choo-choo! Bye Sunshine! Bye Tinkle Winkle! By Puffy! Bye Flade! Bye Gayle!
Santa steps into frame and puts his arm around Buddy.
SANTA
So I hear you're going on a little journey to the big city?
BUDDY
Yeah, but I'm kind of nervous. Jim told me New York is really different.
SANTA
Don't listen to Jim. He's never been anywhere. He doesn't even have any feet. I've been to New York thousands of times.
BUDDY
Wow. What's it like?
SANTA
Well there's some things you should know: first off, if you see gum on the street, leave it there. It's not free candy. Second, there are like thirty Ray's Pizzas and they all say they're the original, but the real one's on eleventh. And if you see a sign for a Peep show, it doesn't mean they're letting you look at presents before Christmas.
BUDDY
So much to remember...
SANTA
Don't worry, something tells me this trip is going to be good for you.
(patting him on the back)
It's time for my Buddy here to spread his wings.
BUDDY
I can't wait! Me and Dad are gonna go ice-skating and eat sugarplums!
SANTA
That's the other thing I wanted to talk to you about. You see, Buddy, your father... Well he's on the naughty list.
FAST PUSH INTO:
The NAUGHTY LIST, landing on ""Walter Hobbs.""
BUDDY
NOOOOOO!!!!
SANTA
I'm sorry, but it's true.
BUDDY
My stomach hurts. It feels like evil.
SANTA
Listen, Buddy, some people. They get mixed up about what's important in life. But that doesn't mean they can't change. Maybe your dad just needs a little Christmas spirit!
BUDDY
I'm good at that!
SANTA
I know you are.
Papa Elf steps forward, trying to hide the fact that he's tearing up. He and Buddy embrace.
PAPA ELF
I love you, Buddy. And I'll always be here for you.
(crying)
Now go on, get!
BUDDY
(crying)
Yes, Papa.
(crying and skipping)
Bye guys. I'll miss you. I really will.
EXT. NORTH POLE - NIGHT
Animals wave as Buddy heads off into the unknown.
ANIMALS
Bye, Buddy.
BUDDY
Bye lovable woodland animals!
EXT. NORTH POLE - NIGHT
Buddy sits on an ice flow. He drifts along the cold sea through a haze, transitioning from the MAGIC LAND of the north pole to the REAL WORLD.
EXT. SNOW FIELD - DAY
Buddy trudges through a massive snow field. Each step he takes goes down five feet deep, we DISSOLVE to a series of scenes showing this epic struggle. He wears a beard of ice.
Exhausted, Buddy considers leaving himself for dead, but uses his last ounce of strength to pull out the old PHOTO of his father, WALTER HOBBS.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. GREENWAY PRESS - EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - MEANWHILE
A large children's storybook publishing company. LARGE-SIZED book covers line the wall. ""Max the Big Blue Cat"", ""The Adventures of Rabbit Gang & Pop"", etc. This place runs like a well-oiled machine.
A huge corner office says 'WALTER HOBBS, EDITOR.'
INT. WALTER HOBBS' OFFICE - DAY
Walter is the guy from Buddy's picture, only he looks a little older and a little meaner.
A NUN stands in front of Walter's large desk.
NUN
You're taking the books back?
WALTER
Hey, you're the one who's behind on the payments, don't try to make me out to be the bad guy here.
NUN
We're trying to get yo the money, but it's been difficult to raise the funding...the children are sponsoring another bake sale next month. That should help.
WALTER
See, there's your problem. You can't expect a bake sale to make solid cash these days. Places like Dunkin' Donuts and Cinnibon are expanding their product base with alternative breakfast and desert items. Even Starbucks carries baked goods. You guys really need to start thinking out of the box.
(out window; to NYC)
It's called capitalism, Miss Peters. If you can't stand the heat, move to Canada.
NUN
(begging)
The kids really love the books.
WALTER
You don't need to tell me that, I made them. I'm the one who ran the focus groups.
DEB, the secretary, pokes her head in.
DEB
Mr. Hobbs, your two o'clock is here.
WALTER
Would you please use the intercom? We talked about this.
DEB
Do you want me to use it now? I mean, I already told you.
Walter purposefully ignores her. Deb leaves frame and now we hear her on the intercom.
DEB (O.S.)
(from intercom)
Mr. Hobbs, your two o'clock is here.
WALTER
(hitting button)
Got it.
(to Nun, compassionate)
Tell you what, I know how much these books mean to your kids over there...
(beat)
I'll give you a three-week extension.
NUN
(sarcastic)
Bless your heart.
WALTER
(too busy to hear)
If I were you, I'd stay away from perishable goods. Think consumer services. That's hot right now.
EXT. CANADA - DAY
Buddy is half-way there. He's now clearly in the real world. He walks through a choppy, muddy, snowy terrain past a rusted propane tank. A REAL LIVE RACCOON crosses his path. Buddy acts like it's a cartoon.
BUDDY
Heyyyy. What's your name? I'm Buddy!
Buddy corners the raccoon, trapping it. Trying to be nice. IT hisses like crazy. But Buddy is undeterred.
BUDDY
Sounds like someone needs a hug!
He lunges forward. Like lightning, the raccoon BITES Buddy in the face.
BUDDY
NUT CRACKERS!!!
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
Buddy walks along the Highway, looks up, then stops in his tracks.
REVEAL: A sign that says NEW YORK CITY/LINCOLN TUNNEL. His eyes light up.
EXT. MANHATTAN - MORNING
We see Buddy timidly inch his way through the Lincoln Tunnel along the walkway, pressed up against the wall while traffic roars by. Like a stray cat, Buddy dodges through traffic. His feelings of wonder are starting to be replaced with fear. He exits to the sight of the towering skyline of New York City with the sun breaking over it. He sees the Empire State Building, then looks at his snow globe.
BUDDY
Whoa...
EXT. MID-TOWN MANHATTAN - LATER
Buddy is caught up in the rhythms of the street and begins noticing the mundane details of this new world with amazement: traffic lights. Steam. Scaffolding.
WIDE SHOT
EXT. TIMES SQUARE - CONTINUOUS
Buddy attempts to greet a sea of people, but New Yorkers ignore the guy in the Elf suit.
BUDDY
Hi.
(no response; next person)
Happy afternoon!
(no response; next person)
Salutations!
-- A woman tries to hail A cab. Buddy waves back.
-- Buddy looks up at awe at the animated billboard on the Lehman Building. A guy bumps into him.
WALKER
Why don't you watch your ass, buddy!
Buddy nods, then sticks his butt out and looks at it.
-- Buddy runs round and round A revolving door and loving every moment.
-- A sign at a crappy diner ""World's Best Cup of Coffee!"" Buddy is excited and enters. The jaded BANGLADESHI STAFF stares at him blankly.
BUDDY
Wow! The world's best cup of coffee! You did it! Congratulations! To all of you!
-- Gum on the ground. Yum!Buddy picks it up, plays with it, then pops it in his mouth and chews with A smile. Now his face suddenly changes.
-- Two guys are handing out different flyers. Buddy is given one. HE looks at it, then, in Marx Brothers-like fashion, hands it to flyer guy #2. Flyer guy #2 takes it, then gives Buddy one of his own flyers. This delights Buddy, who now repeats the ri
-- A dog walker picks up some dog crap with newspaper. Buddy sees some other crap on the sidewalk, grabs some newspaper and picks it up. Buddy walks right behind the man and offers it to him to be helpful.
REVEAL: Empire State Building!
Buddy holds up his Empire State Building SNOW GLOBE and compares the skyscraper to his toy one.
BUDDY
Dad...
INT. WALTER HOBBS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
ECU: The PUPPY AND THE PIGEON book is in Walter's hands. A PRINTER faces him.
WALTER
A re-print? Do you know how much that's gonna cost?
PRINTER
Two whole pages are missing. The story makes no sense.
WALTER
You think a kid is going to notice two pages? All they do is look at the pictures.
INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS
Buddy gets in the elevator with a bunch of Republican-looking PEOPLE. He's whistling really loud and happy, confusing them.
Another passenger gets on.
ACCOUNTANT
Can you press 67 please?
Unsure of what may happen, he pushes 67. The number LIGHTS UP.
BUDDY
Hey, that's pretty.
Like lightning, he presses ALL 75 BUTTONS.
BUDDY
Look at that!
QUICK CUTS
The elevator doors open and close, floor by floor. No one is smiling, except for
Buddy.
INT. WALTER HOBBS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Walter and the printer continue.
WALTER
How the hell did this happen, anyway?
PRINTER
Well, you signed off on all the final plates and...
WALTER
You know what? I don't need to know. Let's just get this solved.
INT. DEB'S DESK - CONTINUOUS
Deb stares dead pan at the Elf in front of her desk.
BUDDY
Buddy the Elf, here for a Mr. Walter Hobbs, please.
DEB
You look hilarious. Who sent you?
BUDDY
Papa Elf, from the North Pole.
DEB
Papa Elf? That's rich.
INT. WALTER HOBBS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Walter and the printer continue.
PRINTER
You really think we should ship them?
WALTER
(sarcastic)
No, I want to take a thirty-thousand dollar bath, so some kid understands what happened to a friggin' Puppy and a Pigeon.
(beat)
Ship them!
DEB (O.S.)
(over intercom)
Mr. Hobbs, it's me on the intercom.
WALTER
Go ahead.
DEB (O.S.)
I think someone sent you a Christmas-gram.
WALTER
A Christmas-gram? I don't have time for a Christmas-gram.
Over Walter's shoulder, we see Buddy step into frame behind him. Sensing this, Walter slowly turns around.
BUDDY
Dad?
Looking nervous and excited, he adjusts his hat and vest.
WALTER
Oh, um, alright. Let's get this over with.
We see a small crowd of people have gathered by the door to watch the supposed singing telegram.
BUDDY
I walked all day and night to find you.
WALTER
(playing along)
Looks like you came from the North Pole.
BUDDY
That's exactly where I came from. Santa must've called you.
WALTER
Yeah, I just got off my cell with him. So? Go on.
BUDDY
Go on with what?
WALTER
Are you gonna sing a song or can I get back to work?
BUDDY
A song? Anything for you, Dad. Let's see...
(trying to make up a song)
I'M HERE WITH MY DAD. I'VE NEVER MET HIM AND HE WANTS ME TO SING A SONG. I WAS ADOPTED AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW I WAS BORN. BUT I'M HERE AND I LOVE YOU, DAD!!!
He hugs him.
WALTER
Wow. That's weird. Usually you guys just put my name into a Jingle Bells or something.
BUDDY
It's me, your son! Susan Welles had me and didn't tell you, but now here I am! It's me, Buddy!
WALTER
Susan Welles?! Did you just say Susan Welles? What kind of Christmas gram is this?
BUDDY
What's a Christmas gram?
WALTER
(whispering)
Deb, we may want to call security.
DEB
(whispering)
I already did.
Buddy leans in.
BUDDY
(whispering)
I like to whisper, too.
EXT. STREET - FIVE MINUTES LATER
TWO SECURITY GUARDS have each of Buddy's arms and are frog-walking him out the front doors and onto the sidewalk.
BUDDY
My dad runs this whole company! I bet he's a genius.
SECURITY GUARD #2
Must run in the family.
(they laugh)
I wouldn't come back for a while if I were you.
BUDDY
Yeah, it seemed like he may need some 'Daddy time.'
(as he's escorted)
You guys are strong!
SECURITY GUARD #1
Yeah, get lost.
BUDDY
I already am lost!
They throw Buddy's JINGLED hat at him and walk back inside.
BUDDY
Bye, Glenn. Bye Chris!
Buddy picks up his hat, dusts it off, then looks across the street and sees New York's version of ELF MECCA
REVEAL
EXT. GIMBELS DEPARTMENT STORE - CONTINUOUS
It's huge. Full of lights and music, Christmas at its grandest.
BUDDY
(face aglow)
Wow!
Buddy starts skipping across the street toward Gimbels when --
BAM! Buddy's hit by a CAB! He flies off-screen. This is totally shocking. Traffic stops. And now Buddy comes skipping back into frame.
BUDDY
I'm okay! Thank you!
EXT. GIMBELS - CONTINUOUS
The halls are decked. This is epic. Buddy walks through happy in his Elf suit. A PERFUME CLERK approaches.
PERFUME CLERK
Passion fruit spray?
BUDDY
Fruit Spray? For real?
Buddy opens his mouth and closes his eyes. The clerk just stares at him.
BUDDY
(mouth open)
Ready when you are!
The clerk looks around, then, mildly curious, sprays it i n like Binacca. PSST!
Yuch! Buddy stumbles around blind, scraping his tongue off. About to throw up.
MONTAGE: Buddy Does Gimbels
ESCALATOR
Buddy stops at the edge of an escalator, afraid to get on, like a kid at the edge of a diving board. He's clogging tons of holiday traffic.
ANGRY MAN
(annoyed)
Are you going or what?
BUDDY
Um, yeah...
Buddy steps forward with one leg. And the escalator yanks him into the splits.
BUDDY
Jiminy Christmas!
PUBLIC BATHROOM
Buddy leaves the stall, then accosts a stranger.
BUDDY
Have you seen this toilet!? It's GI-NORMOUS!!!
(to another guy)
Look at this toilet!
STORE
Buddy grabs 3,000 candy canes and starts eating them with great intensity.
ELEVATOR
Buddy faces the wrong way in the elevator, face to face with a man.
ANGRY MAN
(about to punch him)
You think you're pretty smart, huh?
BUDDY
I'm not that smart, but thanks.
LINGERIE SECTION
Buddy sees a display of sexy nighties with a sign over it: For that special someone!
BUDDY
For that special someone? Hmmm...
A HARD-ASS ELF MANAGER walks over.
ELF MANAGER
Man, what in the hell are you doing fartin' around on the first floor?
BUDDY
Looking at shiny things.
ELF MANAGER
Shiny things?? Get your butt back up to the ninth floor before I put my foot up your green ass.
BUDDY
Okay.
INT. GIMBELS - 9TH FLOOR SANTA LAND - LATER
We PAN a LAME SANTA LAND. It's not very impressive. Buddy is doing a thorough inspection.
BUDDY
This snow looks fake.
ELF MANAGER
It's white, ain't it?
BUDDY
Snow doesn't just pile up unless it's moved through the use of a tool, such as a shovel. I would give this some natural erosion, a slight wind drift look.
ELF MANAGER
What the hell are you talkin' about? EROSION?! Don't touch the damn snow. What are you smiling at? You think I'm a joke?
BUDDY
Oh, no, I'm just smiling. Smiling is my favorite.
ELF MANAGER
Well take it down a notch.
Buddy tries to frown for a second, but his lips quiver and hurt and now he's smiling again, making the exact same face.
ELF MANAGER
Alright, smiley, sweep the tin foil off this path. Santa's going to be here tomorrow.
BUDDY
SANTA?!
(eyes wide)
OH...MY...GOD!!!!
(suddenly skeptical)
Wait. Santa Claus?
ELF MANAGER
Yeah. Where've you been?
BUDDY
The North Pole.
ELF MANAGER
Ha. Ha. Start elfing.
(as he leaves)
And don't touch the snow.
He walks off, looking back, annoyed. Now something grabs Buddy's full attention.
BUDDY'S POV
SLO-MO - JOVIE DAVIS. 20s, a petite beauty, dressed as an Elf. She glides like a vision to the Christmas tree where she hangs balls from a ladder. Buddy stares up at her.
JOVIE
Are you enjoying the view?
BUDDY
Yes I am! I was standing over there and I thought you looked pretty so I came over to tell you that you look pretty.
JOVIE
Why're you messin' with me? Did Krumpet put you up to this?
BUDDY
I'm not messing with you. It's nice to meet a human who shares my affinity for the Elf culture.
JOVIE
I wouldn't call it an affinity. I'm just trying to get through the holidays.
BUDDY
Get through? Christmas is the greatest day in the whole wide world!
JOVIE
Well someone's been drinking the Kool Aid.
(Buddy doesn't get it)
Believe me, after a few years of this, you'll learn to tune it all out.
BUDDY
Uh-oh. It sounds like someone needs to sing a Christmas Carol!
JOVIE
(confused)
Are you serious?
BUDDY
The best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear.
JOVIE
Well, thanks, but I don't sing.
BUDDY
Oh, it's easy! It's just like talking, only louder and longer and you move it up and down.
JOVIE
Well, I can sing. I just don't sing. Especially in front of other people. I could never do that.
BUDDY
Never? If you can sing by yourself, you can sing anytime, there's no difference.
JOVIE
Actually, there's a big difference.
BUDDY
No there isn't. Watch.
(suddenly singing loudly)
I'M IN A STORE AND I'M SINGING! PEOPLE ARE HERE AND I'M IN A STORE!!
Everyone looks at him like he's...well, Elf. Jovie seems a little uncomfortable.
BUDDY
THE STORE IS ALL SHINY AND I'M IN A STORE!!
(then back to normal)
See?
JOVIE
(bewildered)
Wow.
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
(over loudspeaker)
Attention, Gimbels will be closing in ten minutes. Please make your final purchases.
All the elves look relieved. Their day is over.
J
OVIE
Dismissed.
BUDDY
You're leaving? But Santa's coming.
JOVIE
(she laughs at his 'joke')
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow, um, what's your name?
BUDDY
Buddy.
JOVIE
Jovie. See ya.
With that, Jovie walks off. Buddy looks around as the half-baked Santa Land empties out.
QUICK SERIES OF CUTS
The doors being locked, employees exiting, lights flickering off.
A SECURITY GUARD WALKS DOWN AN AISLE
Behind him, Buddy does a commando roll through the aisle. Then pops up next to some toys.
Buddy starts pulling all sorts of things off the shelves: paint, robots, a fire truck...he looks at a logo.
BUDDY
They have Elves in Taiwan?
INT. HOBBS' APARTMENT - NIGHT
EMILY has prepared a beautiful dinner. She is an attractive, upper East-side woman.
Walter fills a plate. Their son, MICHAEL, 10, eats without enthusiasm, detached.
WALTER
I'm gonna go eat in my den, okay? I've got a bunch of stuff to go over.
EMILY
Are you sure?
WALTER
Yeah, I'm way behind on a bunch of stuff.
He goes to kiss her on the forehead, she doesn't offer it. So he kisses the top of her hair...and now leaves.
MICHAEL
Can I eat in my room?
EMILY
No.
MICHAEL
Why not? Dad's eating in his den.
(smart ass)
I have a bunch of homework to go over...I'm way behind on a bunch of stuff.
EMILY
You're eating here.
MICHAEL
Fine. But I'm not going to talk.
EMILY
Yes you are. You're going to tell me how your day was.
(beat)
How was your day?
Michael stares tight-lipped. This infuriates Emily.
EMILY
(suddenly)
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?!
MICHAEL
It was fine! Okay? Good.
INT. WALTER'S DEN - LATER
Walter is looking at an OLD YEAR BOOK. He studies a picture of a young, beautiful 'Susan Welles.'
EMILY
What're you looking at?
Walter hides the book.
WALTER
Nothing. It's for work.
EMILY
You know, it'd be nice if we ate together as a family once in a while.
WALTER
I'm sorry. I've gotta work. How do you think I feel? You think I like to work?
EMILY
Actually, I do.
(beat)
I'm really worried about Michael. He's getting detached and cynical. They're not supposed to do that until they're teenagers.
WALTER
Well he is thirteen years old.
EMILY
He's ten.
(exasperated)
I don't know what's going on with you, but I've just about had it.
WALTER
Had it with what?
That was the wrong answer.
WALTER
Emily. Wait. I'm sorry. I've been under a lot of stress at work.
EMILY
If you say the word WORK one more time, you're sleeping at the Marriot.
WALTER
(a tiny ounce of charm)
The chicken thing was delicious.
EMILY
It wasn't a chicken thing. It was salmon, zucchini, string beans, carrots, cherry tomatoes, asparagus, mushrooms and olives.
WALTER
Well it was good.
INT. GIMBELS - SANTA LAND - 7 AM
Buddy is finishing his decorating. We pull out wide: No Santa Land has ever looked more beautiful. The most expensive merchandise has been used as bricks and mortar. A huge glitter sign says ""WELCOME SANTA! LOVE, BUDDY!!!""
Now, off in the distance, WE HEAR THE FAINT SOUND OF AN ANGEL SINGING.
Buddy perks up, training his ear, he slowly rises to his feet, as if following a butterfly, he meanders through the deserted aisles, more and more hypnotized as the angelic singing gets louder and louder and clearer and more beautiful.
Buddy pushes through the bathroom door, totally consumed by the greatest voice in the world.
REVEAL
Jovie is in the shower stall. Singing half of the classic duet, ""BABY, IT'S COLD OUTSIDE"". Buddy stands, hypnotized, outside the shower curtain, quietly joins in and sings the accompanying duet to himself. Eventually he can't help himself and belts out the chorus.
Jovie is silent and quickly twists off the shower and opens the curtain, wearing only a towel.
JOVIE
AHHHHHHHH!!!
BUDDY
AHHHHHHHH!!!
Jovie KICKS BUDDY in the NUTS and escapes. Buddy holds his crotch, confused and frightened.
EXT. GIMBELS - MORNING
A busy Manhattan morning. People are going back to work.
PAN TO
Behind the glass, an idyllic Christmas scene. Buddy is curled up in the faux snow, asleep -- mouth open and drooling, sweaty from the sun.
A MAN SQUINTS
At him through the window amazed at how life-like Buddy is. Buddy itches his crotch, then awakens to the staring man.
BUDDY
Ah! Holy fudge!
Buddy yawns and stretches ridiculously.
BUDDY
Good morning, everyone!
(looking off)
POV
Walter is walking along the sidewalk with his brief case.
BUDDY
Dad!!!
Walter thinks he hears something, but continues. Buddy pounds hard on the window, trapped like a tiger. His voice echoes. Muffled like Dustin Hoffman in THE GRADUATE.
BUDDY
(muted)
DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD!
Walter glances over, then stops in his tracks. It's Buddy. He runs.
INT. LOBBY - LATER
Buddy skips past the security guards with a box. Caught off guard, they have to lunge to grab him.
SECURITY GUARD #1
Hey!
BUDDY
(yelling back; fun)
Hey!!
(beat)
Hi, Glenn. Hi Chris! I just want to give my dad this present. I think he's mad at me...but he won't be after THIS.
SECURITY GUARD #1
You better leave that with us.
SECURITY GUARD #2
Yeah, he's real busy.
BUDDY
Oh, okay. Well, please tell him it's from me, and that I love him so much and that he's the greatest Dad in the world and that I love him. Okay?
SECURITY GUARD #1
Okay.
INT. GIMBELS - SANTA LAND - DAY
Buddy re-enters his new, transformed Santa Land. His face glows with satisfaction.
REVEAL
It's a smash hit. The visitors are ecstatic. 'Look at that!' 'Can you believe it?' etc. Everyone loves it. Except the Elf Manager, who complains to a co-worker.
ELF MANAGER
Who the hell took a dump in housewares?
Jovie walks up to Buddy.
JOVIE
Hey. I want to talk to you.
Buddy is now terrified by her.
BUDDY
Oh, uh, um, okay, uh...
(she lets him squirm)
What do you want to talk about?
JOVIE
What the hell do you think?
BUDDY
I know a pig who can run eleven miles an hour.
JOVIE
Why were you in the woman's locker room?
BUDDY
(sheephish)
I heard you singing.
JOVIE
Singing? Right. I'm sure it had nothing to do with me being naked. I should call the police.
(beat)
What were you doing here so early in the morning?
BUDDY
(re: epic Santa Land)
Making this.
JOVIE
You made this?
BUDDY
Yes...why were you here?
JOVIE
They turned my water off.
(she studies him)
You were standing there with your eyes closed. What is that, some kind of thing you do?
Buddy looks to the floor, and now up and into her eyes.
BUDDY
You have the most beautiful voice in the whole world.
Jovie looks at him, his innocence is contagious.
JOVIE
(sincere, compassionate)
You really were just listening to me, weren't you?
BUDDY
I'm sorry.
The Elf Manager walks over.
MANAGER
This is Santa Land, not stand-around-and-wear-pointy-ass-shoes land. Get busy. Santa's here.
BUDDY
SANTA?! Santa is HERE?!
Buddy sees the back of Santa enter a closed off gazebo. Children are already crowded around.
BUDDY
(happier than ever)
SANTA!
Buddy rushes towards Santa through the crowd, his eyes wide, almost breathless with excitement. Quickly he brushes off his uniform and straightens his cap.
BUDDY
Santa, it's me! Buddy!
Buddy slides the curtain open to reveal: a MAN dressed as Santa. The kids cheer. Buddy's smile drops.
BUDDY
Who the heck are you?
GIMBELS SANTA
Why, I'm Santa Claus.
BUDDY
Are not!
GIMBELS SANTA
Well, of course I am. Ho Ho Ho!
BUDDY
(furious)
If you're Santa, then tell me. What song did I sing for your birthday this year?
GIMBELS SANTA
Why you sang, uh, Happy Birthday?
BUDDY
(to the kids)
He's right.
'Santa' struts past Buddy and takes his chair.
GIMBELS SANTA
(under his breath)
Why don't you cool it, zippy.
(to the kids)
Ho Ho Ho!
The voice is wrong, the smell is wrong.
BUDDY
You're lying! I know it!
Buddy attacks. He grabs Santa's bear and it comes right off. Buddy looks at the beard in shock, like a horror movie.
BUDDY
(at the beard, horrified)
AAHHHH!!! Imposter! He's an imposter!!! His beard is fake! Come on, kids, get him!
The kids all pile on, wrestling Santa, loving it. Now the manager dives in and tries to help. Some parents and other elves try to contain the disaster in panic.
Jovie giggles. She is confused but intrigued by this mysterious stranger.
INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - GREENWAY PRESS - DAY
Walter sits behind his desk staring at the note that accompanied the package from Buddy. The package sits on the desk, still wrapped in a Gimbels box. The note says ""Dad, this is for you because you are my special someone.""
Walter unwraps the gift, then holds up a RED SLINKY NIGHTIE with fur where the nipples would be.
Deb enters and he scrambles to hide the nightie.
DEB
Hey the -- what's that?
WALTER
What's what?
(beat)
Intercom!
DEB
Right.
She leaves. Walter looks deeper into the box and sees a card. It's the old photo of a young Walter next to his smiling girlfriend - on the other side is a crayon drawing of Buddy.
DEB (O.S.)
(from intercom)
Walter, the police are on line one.
WALTER
The police?
(grabbing phone)
Hello? My son? Michael? Is he okay?
(listening)
An Elf? He's not my -- you know what? Keep him there. I'll be right down.
Deb peeks in.
DEB
What's going on?
WALTER
Nothing. I need to go.
(lying)
I need to swing by my apartment real quick...they're delivering a chair.
DEB
(smart ass)
A police chair?
WALTER
It's a regular chair. Okay?! Cancel my appointments.
INT. JAIL - DAY
A scary jail cell. Buddy looks around from his cot. Everything is cold and hard and ugly and mean.
And now he STARTS TO CRY. He sticks his face into the pillow and cries hard.
REVEAL
Another convict shares the cell with him. He stares at Buddy with disgust.
But now, slowly, it's contagious. The CONVICT CAN'T HELP IT AND HE STARTS TO CRY TOO.
Buddy hears the cell door clang open.
REVEAL
Walter stands at the open jail cell door.
BUDDY
Dad!!!
Buddy wipes his tears and rubs his face. Trying to look like a good son.
The convict wipes his tears away too, sitting up straight. But now starts crying again.
EXT. POLICE PRECINCT - DAY
Walter marches out of the front doors, Buddy following closely behind, almost like a puppy dog trying to keep up.
Walter is about to burst but holds back, until they're clear of the station.
BUDDY
I'm so happy! I knew you'd come! I love that you came and I love you Dad! Know how much I love you?
(spreading his arms wide)
This much. Except my arms would have to be way longer, like pterodactyl wings --
WALTER
Alright, pal. Who the heck are you and what's your problem?
BUDDY
I'm Buddy. Your son.
WALTER
I already have a son!
BUDDY
Then who am I?
WALTER
Where did you get this picture?!
He holds up the picture he included in the gift.
BUDDY
Papa Elf gave it to me.
Walter shakes Buddy violently by the lapels. Buddy's scared.
WALTER
Is this some kind of game? What do you want, money?!
BUDDY
I just wanted to meet you...and I thought that, maybe, you might want to meet me...
Walter senses an element of truth in here somewhere.
WALTER
(serious)
You really believe this, don't you?
BUDDY
I thought we could make ginger bread houses and eat cookie dough and go ice skating and hold hands. I'm sorry if I made you mad.
WALTER
(conflicted)
Come with me.
Their silhouettes walk together away from camera. Buddy REACHES OUT TO HOLD HANDS, but Walter's hands stay in his trench coat...Buddy is still holding his hand out. Walter suddenly SMACKS BUDDY'S HAND DOWN.
INT. PEDIATRICIAN'S OFFICE - AN HOUR LATER
Buddy sits on the examining table as Walter watches.
PROP NOTE: Del Close's skull sits on a shelf in the B.G.
Buddy reaches into a jar of cotton balls and starts eating them quickly one at a time. Like cotton candy nuggets.
WALTER
Don't eat those.
Buddy goes to eat one more, Walter tries to grab his arm but Buddy fakes him out and eats it anyway.
BUDDY
Am I sick?
WALTER
YES.
(beat)
But that's not why we're here. We're here to test whether you're my son or not.
BUDDY
Why am I sitting on paper?
Buddy pulls the roll and paper spills out everywhere. The doctor and Walter try to stop him, but get tangled up.
DOCTOR
So it's clean for each patient that comes in. Try to sit still. I'm going to perform something called a 'finger prick.'
BUDDY
(happy)
Finger prick!
(to the Doctor)
Can I wear your head lamp?
DOCTOR
No.
BUDDY
Why?
DOCTOR
Just sit still.
BUDDY
Why is there a skeleton on the wall?
DOCTOR
I don't know but there just is.
BUDDY
What's his name?
WALTER
He doesn't have a name!
BUDDY
If I squint, he looks like a pirate flag. Arrgh!
DOCTOR
Walter, I can't do this if he's going to keep moving around.
WALTER
I'm sorry Ben. Buddy! Please!
BUDDY
(whispering)
He got mad at me.
WALTER
Buddy the sooner you sit still, the sooner we can clear up this horrible mess.
BUDDY
After this, can we eat sugar plums together?
WALTER
Sure! We'll eat sugar plums, and make ginger bread houses, and paint eggs!
BUDDY
That's Easter not -
The Doctor gives Buddy's finger a tiny prick.
BUDDY
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!
Buddy shoves the doctor over and stumbles around holding his finger and crying.
BUDDY
Boot straps! Snow flickers! Son of a cobbler!
INT. WAITING ROOM - LATER
Buddy holds his finger with a cotton ball for a moment. Then suddenly eats it.
Now he taps his finger and flips it around like it's dead, then turns to a LITTLE GIRL, 7, who is playing with her doll as her MOTHER fills out paperwork with the nurse.
BUDDY
My finger has a heartbeat.
GIRL
It won't hurt so much after a little. What's your name?
BUDDY
Buddy.
GIRL
I'm Carolyn.
BUDDY
And what do you want for Christmas?
CAROLYN
A Suzie-Talks-A-Lot.
BUDDY
I'll put in a good word with the big man.
CAROLYN
Thanks. Your costume is pretty.
BUDDY
Oh, it's not a costume. I'm an Elf. Well, I'm a human, technically. But I was raised by Elves.
GIRL
(totally unfazed)
Oh. I'm a human...raised by humans.
BUDDY
Cool.
INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Walter is waiting for the results.
WALTER
Well?
DOCTOR
Well...
(beat)
It's a boy.
The blood drains out of Walter's face.
WALTER
It's impossible.
(feeling faint)
Is the test ever wrong?
DOCTOR
No.
WALTER
My God. What'm I supposed to do? You saw the guy, he's certifiably insane!
DOCTOR
Walter, I've read about some things that suggest Buddy's behavior isn't necessarily that unusual.
WALTER
The man skips.
DOCTOR
It's rare, but there have been documented cases of people like your son.
WALTER
His name's BUDDY.
DOCTOR
Well, BUDDY's been denied a proper childhoood with you. It's possible he may feel he was never fully nurtured, causing an alternative personality to develop.
WALTER
An Elf.
DOCTOR
Yes.
(beat)
I think he's trying to return to a position of child-like dependency.
WALTER
So, let's get him some pills or whatever. I'll pay for them, it's not a problem.
DOCTOR
I think what he really needs is you. This is an extreme case. A rejection now could be especially traumatic.
WALTER
So, what do you want me to do, breast feed him?
DOCTOR
What if you let him visit you? Meet the family, that sort of thing. It may help him feel like he's a part of your life.
(off Walter's look)
He's your son Walter, it's not like he's going to just go away.
EXT. EMILY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Emily is leaving work, locking up the door. She turns to find Walter standing there at the bottom of the steps, hands in his pockets, smiling.
EMILY
What are you doing here?
WALTER
I was in the neighborhood. I thought I'd walk you home.
EMILY
You thought you'd walk me home?
They begin to walk together.
WALTER
What, is that so weird?
EMILY
I've worked here for four years. You've never walked me anywhere.
WALTER
Well it's a nice night.
EMILY
What's wrong?
WALTER
Why does something have to be wrong? I just said, it's a nice night, I mean really!
EMILY
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
(taking his arm)
Thanks, this is really nice.
On Walter as he walks.
WALTER
Okay, something's a little wrong.
INT. HOBB'S RESIDENCE - LATER
They're arriving home.
EMILY
Oh, God...that's well, it's...it's Wonderful Walter. You have a son.
WALTER
Wonderful. That's one way to put it.
EMILY
Oh c'mon. This is incredible. It may be a little complicated, but it's nothing we can't handle.
WALTER
He thinks he's an Elf.
EMILY
I'm sorry, what?
WALTER
He thinks he's a Christmas Elf.
EMILY
Oh, I'm sure he doesn't really think...
Walter swings open the door to the apartment to reveal:
INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
BUDDY HAS BEEN BUSY. The place is a recycled winter wonderland. Yards of old garland has been meticulously strung throughout the apartment. Elaborate construction paper Christmas murals cover the walls. His sense of decorating is impeccable. Emily is floored.
MEANWHILE...in the kitchen, Buddy scoops globs of frosting into his mouth at a furious pace.
WALTER
Buddy?
Buddy looks up, drooling.
WALTER
This is Emily.
EMILY
(muffled, mouth full)
Emuree!
Swallows frosting hard. He jumps up and gives her a big hug.
BUDDY
Walter hasn't told me anything about you!!!
Meanwhile, Michael, their son, has arrived.
MICHAEL
Why is mom hugging Robin Hood?
INT. DINING ROOM - AN HOUR LATER
Walter, Emily, Michael and Buddy are seated around the dining room table eating spaghetti.
BUDDY
...then I traveled through the seven levels of the candy cane forest, past the castle of the abominable snowman and past the sea of swirly, twirly gumdrops. And then I walked through the Lincoln tunnel. Can you pass the Coke pretty please?
Michael hands over a two-liter. Instead of pouring it in his glass, Buddy chugs the entire thing. The family watches, amazed.
EMILY
So, where exactly have you been for the last thirty years?
WALTER
The North Pole. He's an ""Elf"". That's where elves live.
BUDDY
He's right. Can you pass the maple syrup, pretty please.
EMILY
I'm sorry. I didn't set out any syrup. It's spaghetti.
BUDDY
That's okay, I think I have some...
Buddy pulls some syrup out of his breast pocket and pours it over his spaghetti. Walter and Michael share a disgusted look, the first time they've been in agreement on anything in a while.
EMILY
You like sugar, huh?
BUDDY
Is there sugar in syrup?
EMILY
Yes.
BUDDY
Then yes! We Elves try to stick to the four basic food groups: Candy, candy canes, candy corns and syrup.
EMILY
So, will you be staying with us, then?
WALTER
Emily.
BUDDY
You mean I can stay?
WALTER
Emily!
EMILY
Oh, don't be silly. Of course you can. How long do you think you'll be with us?
BUDDY
Well, I hadn't really planned it out, but I was thinking, like, forever?
WALTER
EMILY!?
EMILY
WHAT?!
WALTER
May I speak with you in the kitchen for a moment?
EMILY
Um, sure. Excuse me, Buddy.
Left alone, Buddy stares at Michael. Michael ignores him. Turning his whole chair away. Buddy looks around for a moment. And now suddenly BURPS so loud and long, it's insane.
BUDDY
Wow, did you hear that?
Yes, Michael did...
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Walter argues with Emily in hushed tones.
WALTER
Are you crazy? He can't stay here.
EMILY
Clearly he has some serious issues. We can't just kick him out in the snow.
WALTER
Why not? He loves the snow! He told me fifteen times!
EMILY
Seriously Walter! He's alone in New York. What's he supposed to do?
WALTER
That's his problem.
EMILY
He's your son. That means it's our problem.
INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Buddy and Michael sit in silence. Buddy isn't sure what to say.
BUDDY
I love you.
MICHAEL
Eat me.
BUDDY
Eat you? OKAY!
(playing, like the jungle)
I'm a Lion! Roar! CHOMP!
INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER
Buddy is on the living room couch. Walter is tucking him in, trying to leave.
BUDDY
Goodnight, Dad.
WALTER
Goodnight.
BUDDY
Tuck me in?
WALTER
What?!
BUDDY
I can't fall asleep if I'm not tucked in.
WALTER
I'm not tucking you in!
BUDDY
I promise I'll go right to sleep.
WALTER
(reluctantly)
Fine...
BUDDY
TICKLE FIGHT!!!
Walter fights him off, pissed.
WALTER
No. Buddy. Stop!
BUDDY
Sorry.
WALTER
Just lay down and go to sleep, okay?
BUDDY
Do you want to hear a story?
WALTER
No. When this light goes off, you are not getting up. Understand?
BUDDY
Understand.
(Walter flicks off light)
Dad?
(flicks light on)
WALTER
What?
BUDDY
I love you.
WALTER
Go to sleep.
BUDDY
Do you love me?
WALTER
Yeah sure. Now go to sleep.
BUDDY
How much do you love me. Like on a scale from one to ten?
WALTER
Well, I haven't known you for very long, but I would say my feelings are...significant.
BUDDY
(to himself; satisfied)
Significant
WALTER
Good night.
The lights go out for the last time. Walter closes the door and Buddy is alone in the DARK.
BUDDY
(in the dark)
Dad.
(long beat)
Dad?
(long beat)
DAD?
(long beat)
DAD?!
(longer beat)
DAD!!!!
The door suddenly swings open and light shoots into the room.
WALTER
WHAT!!!
BUDDY
Hi.
Walter slams the door. It's dark again.
BUDDY
Dad?
INT. HOBBS' KITCHEN - MORNING
Buddy has prepared a huge batch of spaghetti. The table is set up like a deranged thanksgiving feast. Buddy, the host, hurries around the kitchen as Emily eats.
EMILY
This sure is something, I'm usually the one making breakfast.
BUDDY
Want some more spaghetti?
EMILY
Um, sure, why not.
Buddy dumps more spaghetti on her plate. Then sprinkles it with candy snow caps.
EMILY
So how'd you sleep last night?
BUDDY
Great. I got a full forty minutes and still had time to build a rocking horse.
We see a painted and trimmed rocking horse in the corner.
EMILY
My gosh, you built that? Where did you get the wood?
WALTER (O.S.)
Why is the TV on the ground?
REVEAL:
The ENTERTAINMENT CENTER has been completely dismantled to provide wood for the rocking horse. Sawdust and paint litter the living room.
Walter walks into the kitchen, flabbergasted.
EMILY
Good morning, honey.
(she kisses her husband)
Buddy made us breakfast, isn't that nice?
Walter looks at the...spaghetti. So many things to say, but no place to begin.
EMILY
He packed us lunches too.
REVEAL:
THREE BAGS of spaghetti have each person's name written in calligraphy.
EMILY
Well, I gotta run. Thanks for breakfast, Buddy.
(grabbing her bag)
And the lunch!
She kisses him on the cheek and leaves.
BUDDY
Bye Emily!
Buddy takes a huge spoon and lifts three pounds of spaghetti into frame.
BUDDY
(to Walter)
So, how many scoops?
WALTER
I'm going to stick with coffee for now.
Now MICHAEL ENTERS. He doesn't care to notice the weird food.
MICHAEL
(to Walter, awkward)
I need my allowance.
WALTER
(awkward)
Did you do the recycling?
MICHAEL
Yeah, I did, okay?
Walter peels off a twenty and Michael immediately shoves it into his pocket.
BUDDY
How come you guys don't hug? We always hug in the morning.
WALTER
(lying)
We hugged earlier.
MICHAEL
(partner in crime)
Yeah, we hugged already. Bye.
BUDDY
Bye!
Walter and Buddy are now alone.
WALTER
Listen, Buddy, I wanted to talk to you.
BUDDY
Good, I wanted to talk to you too. I've planned our whole day...
He's made a list on the Etch-a-sketch.
BUDDY
First we make snow angels for two hours, then we go ice-skating and then we eat a log of toll house cookie dough as fast as we can and then, to wrap up the day, we snuggle.
WALTER
Buddy, I have to go to work.
(beat)
And another thing, if you're going to be staying here, you should think about getting rid of the costume. We've got neighbors and people around here, you know?
BUDDY
(looking at himself)
I've worn this my whole life.
WALTER
Yeah, well, you're not in the North Pole anymore.
Buddy is unsure.
WALTER
You said you wanted to make me happy, didn't you?
BUDDY
More than anything.
WALTER
Then lose the tights...as soon as possible.
BUDDY
As soon as possible?
WALTER
As soon as possible.
BUDDY
(sighing)
Yes, papa.
Walter turns and faces camera, pouring coffee. Behind him, Buddy TAKES HIS GREEN TIGHTS OFF and stands there NAKED from the waist down. (The audience is spared the details).
From the rear, Emily re-enters the kitchen and sees Buddy from behind.
EMILY
I almost forg --- AHHHHH!!!!!!
Walter spills his coffee and turns to see Buddy from the front.
WALTER
AHHHHHHH!!!!
BUDDY
(as if it's a game)
AHHHHH!!!!
EXT. MANHATTAN - LATER
Walking to work, Walter answers his cell phone.
WALTER
(answering his cell)
Walter Hobbs.
BUDDY (O.S.)
(from phone)
It worked! It's you!
We intercut Buddy at home, he's shocked by the technology.
WALTER
How'd you get this number?
BUDDY
Emily left an emergency list.
WALTER
Is there an emergency?
BUDDY
There's a horrible sound coming from the evil box by the window! It sounds like this: ERIEKKKCTH!
Walter's ear is trashed before he can pull the phone away.
WALTER
It's not evil. It's the radiator. The heat makes noise when it comes on.
BUDDY
No it's not. Wait yes it is, you were right. Everything's fine!
WALTER
I'm hanging up now.
BUDDY
Okay, I love you, I'll call you in five minutes, I love you!
WALTER
You don't need to call me, Buddy, okay?
BUDDY
Good idea. You call me.
WALTER
Okay, I'm hanging up.
BUDDY
I have a present for you when you get home!
WALTER
I'm hanging up.
BUDDY
I love you!
EXT. UPPER WEST SIDE PRIVATE SCHOOL - LATER
Dozens of kids stream out of school.
Michael is in the middle of the crowd when he hears his name from across the street.
BUDDY (O.S.)
MICHAEL! MICHAEL!
He looks over and sees Buddy cutting through traffic.
MICHAEL
(turns away in embarrassment)
Oh man.
BUDDY
It's me, your brother! Hey, Michael!
Kids start to notice and begin laughing, Michael can't bare it. Michael walks away, ignoring Buddy.
BUDDY
Michael! Wait up!
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LATER
Michael is walking through the park, Buddy trails twelve feet behind, sort of hiding behind trees. But not really.
Michael finally turns and confronts him.
MICHAEL
LEAVE!
BUDDY
How about I leave, then you count to ten and come find me?
MICHAEL
This isn't a game, spaz. Leave NOW. For REAL.
BUDDY
You really want me to leave
MICHAEL
Yes.
BUDDY
(sad)
Oh. Okay. I'll uh, leave, then. I'm sorry.
Just then, a SNOWBALL WHACKS MICHAEL IN THE SHOULDER.
EDGE OF THE RAVINE
A big bunch of JACKASS WANNA-BE teenagers look down at them and laugh.
MICHAEL
Oh, no. These guy are bad news. We better get out of here.
Thump! Michael gets hit in the head.
BUDDY
Ow! PEANUT BRITTLE! SON OF A NUTCRACKER!
Now a barrage of snowballs rain down upon them and they dive behind a fallen tree trunk as snow missiles rip into the barricade.
BUDDY
Dive!
MICHAEL
(genuinely worried)
There are too many of them!
BUDDY
We can do this! Make as many snowballs as you can!
Michael quickly sculpts two snowballs.
WE PAN BACK
To see Buddy has already rounded out a pile of THIRTY.
BUDDY
Ready?
MICHAEL
Yeah.
WIDE SHOT
We can't see Buddy, but we can see the snowballs shooting out of his bunker like a machine gun. A Nolan Ryan fastball ever 1.5 Seconds.
A series of targets explode with precision as this blur of snowballs hits guts, butts, nuts and faces. A kid raises a snowball and it immediately explodes out of his hand. This is the one thing Buddy's actually better at than hockey.
Michael stands to launch one. Exposing himself.
BUDDY
Noooo!
Michael is frozen with shock as a HUGE KID winds up and releases a snowball right at him. Buddy fires a snowball that hits the incoming snowball exploding both of them in mid-air like a patriot missile. They both sit panting.
BUDDY
He's bunkered in! I'm going to flank around from the East. If I don't make it, tell my Dad I love him.
Buddy jumps and charges - and now Michael follows. Buddy descends upon the guy, launching a flurry of snow. The guy finally raises his arms and steps up slowly in surrender.
Buddy looks at the GUY WITH HIS ARMS UP, then winds up and explodes a snowball off his chest at close range.
SNOWBALL GUY
Ow!
(holding his chest)
Hey, I surrendered!
BUDDY
(to Michael)
What does surrendered mean?
INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - LATER
Walter does some paperwork, then hits the intercom.
WALTER
Can you bring me in a bottle of water please?
DEB (O.S.)
(from the intercom)
Fulton Greenway is on his way in.
Fulton Greenway? Walter immediately loses blood in his face.
WALTER
Fulton Greenway? Why didn't you tell me?
DEB (O.S.)
He just showed up. What size water?
WALTER
When's he coming in?
DEB (O.S.)
Now.
WALTER
What do you mean now?
Walter buttons his suit and checks his reflection for nose hairs.
DEB (O.S.)
I mean now. What size?
FULTON GREENWAY (O.S.)
Hobbs!
FULTON GREENWAY, the cut-throat looking owner of the company enters the office. This guy owns Greenway Press, among other things.
WALTER
Fulton! What a great surprise!
FULTON GREENWAY
I haven't seen you since the retreat. You're looking good.
WALTER
Thanks, you too. So, to what do I owe the pleasure?
FULTON GREENWAY
Well, to be honest, I got a call from my niece.
WALTER
Your niece. I don't think I've met her.
FULTON GREENWAY
She's six.
Fulton tosses 'THE PUPPY AND THE PIGEON (the flawed book from earlier) onto Walter's desk. Uh oh.
FULTON GREENWAY
She wants to know how a certain puppy and a certain pigeon escaped the clutches of a certain evil witch.
WALTER
Believe me, we've already started looking at new printers. This one's obviously gotten sloppy.
Greenway holds up the proofs, signed by Walter.
FULTON GREENWAY
Maybe it isn't the printer who's gotten sloppy.
WALTER
(forcing a laugh)
What a disaster, huh? Twenty-five years in publishing, never seen anything like it. Well, I guess you can't bat a thousand, right?
Fulton Greenway nods skeptically. Walter adjusts in his seat.
FULTON GREENWAY
I got news for you, even if those two pages were in there, that book still would have sucked. I read it. I'll tell you, I wish all the pages were missing.
(Walter's dying)
Have you seen the numbers from this quarter?
WALTER
They should be coming in today.
FULTON GREENWAY
(holds up the numbers)
They're in!
WALTER
That good, huh?
FULTON GREENWAY
The Pigeon and the Friggin' Puppy is tanking hard, Hobbs. My people estimate we'll be posting a minus eight for this quarter. A minus eight cannot happen.
WALTER
Well, we'll bounce back. We always do.
FULTON GREENWAY
We're not going to 'bounce back.' We're going to get a new book before the end of the quarter.
WALTER
Before the end of this quarter?
FULTON GREENWAY
I'll be back in town on the twenty fourth. At that time, I'd love to hear, in great detail, exactly what your plans are for this new book.
WALTER
But that's Christmas Eve.
FULTON GREENWAY
And?
WALTER
Hey, no problem. It'll be fun to have you in the loop.
INT. GIMBELS - LATER THAT DAY
Buddy and Michael are goofing around inside Gimbels. Buddy pegs him with a dodge ball. Michael laughs and pegs him back.
MICHAEL
(looking at toy bugs)
Hey, look at this, it's a big mosquito!
BUDDY
What's a mosquito?
MICHAEL
They land on your arm, then stick their needle face down through your skin, suck your blood out and then fly away.
BUDDY
That's a scary toy.
MICHAEL
It's not just a toy. They're real. They're everywhere in the summer.
BUDDY
(horrified)
OH MY GOD.
EXT. GIMBELS - CONTINUOUS
They leave the toy section and walk toward the SANTA LAND that Buddy built. We see the sign has been awkwardly changed to 'Welcome, Santa. Love GIMBELS.'
BUDDY
I wish Dad were here.
MICHAEL
Why?
BUDDY
He's the greatest Dad in the world.
MICHAEL
Are you kidding? He's the worst dad in the world.
BUDDY
What do you mean?
MICHAEL
All he does is work.
BUDDY
Working is fun.
MICHAEL
Not the way he does it. All he cares about is the money. He doesn't care about me, he doesn't care about you, he doesn't care about anybody.
BUDDY
Well, he is on the naughty list.
AND NOW WE SPOT JOVIE
From a distance. She looked adorable before, but this time we're serious.
MICHAEL
You like her?
BUDDY
Like who?
MICHAEL
The girl you're staring at.
BUDDY
Um, yes.
MICHAEL
Why don't you ask her out?
BUDDY
Out to where?
MEANWHILE
Jovie has spotted Buddy. She gives him a shy wave. And now she's WALKING OVER to them.
BUDDY
(flipping out)
We should leave. I need to leave.
MICHAEL
Don't leave! Ask her out!
BUDDY
Out?
MICHAEL
On a date, you know, to eat food.
BUDDY
(Jovie's almost there)
Food.
MICHAEL
(whispering)
If she says yes, you're in. It's like a secret code girls have.
JOVIE
Well look who it is.
BUDDY
Hi Jovie. This is --
Michael has ditched out. Buddy is on his own.
BUDDY
...that's my brother, Michael, over there.
JOVIE
I was wondering if I'd ever see you again. So, did Gimbels give you your job back?
BUDDY
No, but it worked out pretty good. They gave me a restraining order.
JOVIE
You really should get out of here.
BUDDY
But I really wanted to see you. You're beautiful and I feel warm when I'm around you. You make my tongue swell up.
Jovie is embarrassed.
JOVIE
You are the weirdest guy I've ever met in my life.
BUDDY
Weird, like, good?
JOVIE
(smiling)
I haven't decided.
BUDDY
So, do you want to eat food?
JOVIE
Do I want to eat food?
BUDDY
You know...
(winking)
The code...
JOVIE
(letting that slide)
I just took my lunch break.
BUDDY
(defeated)
Oh, right. I follow.
JOVIE
(then)
But I'm free Thursday night.
A wry smile slowly breaks across Buddy's face. And then he suddenly explodes.
BUDDY
(celebrating; ridiculous)
YYEEESSSSSSSSS!
INT. HOBBS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Walter enters and sees Buddy and Michael as they hoist an enormous FOURTEEN FOOT TALL CHRISTMAS TREE into the corner. It scrapes the ceiling as they wedge it in place.
WALTER
What the hell is that?
MICHAEL
A Christmas tree!
WALTER
A Christmas tree?
MICHAEL
Buddy chopped it down in the park!
Buddy smiles at Walter, Walter does not smile back.
INT. WALTER AND EMILY'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Michael and Emily are having a heated discussion.
EMILY
I don't know what you're so worked up about. They're just having a little fun.
WALTER
Fun? Felonies are fun now? I thought felonies were felonies?
EMILY
Okay, the tree thing was bad. We'll have to plant another one. But at least
Michael's happy for once.
(beat)
It's amazing what a little attention will do.
WALTER
What's that supposed to mean?
EMILY
Well, you haven't exactly been there for him lately. He's a kid Walter, he's not going to raise himself.
WALTER
Oh! So let's allow a deranged Elf-man to raise him. Great idea! Maybe we should pull Michael out of school so they can commit felonies full time!
EMILY
I think you're jealous.
WALTER
Jealous? Of Buddy? The man is wearing tights.
INT. LIVING ROOM - MEANWHILE
Buddy uses a drill to secure the trunk to the floor. ZZZZRRrrrr. He then stands at a distance. Like a high jumper, holding a star for the top of the tree in hand.
POV
He eyes a mini-trampoline. Then the top of the tree. And now looks at the star in his hand. This has bad news written all over it.
MICHAEL
Are you sure about this? Maybe we can get a ladder.
BUDDY
A ladder? What's fun about a ladder?
(concentrating)
Ready?
(taking off)
WATCH!!!!
Buddy runs, hits the trampoline, launches himself way off target, shooting a sharp angle into the nearest wall. BAM! HE falls behind the couch and out of sight.
BUDDY (O.S.)
I'm okay.
(then)
I found a quarter!
INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
WALTER
What was that noise?
EMILY
Sounded like Buddy slamming into the wall and falling behind the couch.
WALTER
That guy's a liability. There's no way we're leaving him alone here tomorrow. He'll trash the place. Maybe you should take tomorrow off and, you know, watch him.
EMILY
I can't just take off work. I'm going upstate tomorrow for budget meetings.
WALTER
Well I can't stay home. I'm one bad pitch away from getting fired.
EMILY
Why don't you take him to work with you?
WALTER
Take him to work with me?
EMILY
Yeah, I bet he'd like it.
WALTER
Absolutely never.
SMASH CUT TO:
INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY
The ELEVATOR DOOR DINGS open to reveal Walter & Buddy. Buddy sports a new suit. He looks ever bit the professional as he enters with his father.
CO-WORKER
Hey, Walter.
WALTER
Hey, Jack.
BUDDY
Hello, Jack!
Another co-worker, #2, nods hello.
WALTER
Hey, Sarah.
BUDDY
Hi, Sarah. I love that purple dress. It's purplie.
CO-WORKER #3
How's it going, Walter?
WALTER
Hello, Francisco.
BUDDY
Hey, Francisco! That's fun to say! Francisco!
WALTER
(whispering)
Could you at least lose that damn hat?
BUDDY
I like the hat.
(off Walter's look)
I could try, but I really like it.
INT. HOBBS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Walter sits down at his scattered desk. Deb follows him in with his morning cup of coffee.
WALTER
Thanks, Deb.
BUDDY
Good morning, Deb! You have a very pretty face! You should be on a Christmas card!
DEB
Uh, thanks.
She leaves. Walter watches as Buddy grabs ten different books and immediately decides they're boring.
BUDDY
(to himself)
Fran-cis-co.
WALTER
We're cutting down on your sugar intake.
BUDDY
Why is your name on the door?
WALTER
I bought that door. My name's there so no one else steals it.
BUDDY
Is that a joke, Dad?
WALTER
Yes.
BUDDY
This is your office, isn't it?
WALTER
Well how about that? He's understanding sarcasm.
BUDDY
So what are we going to build?
WALTER
This really isn't that kind of work.
THE PHONE RINGS, Buddy beats Walter to it.
BUDDY
(super-fast into phone)
Buddy the Elf! What's your favorite color?
Walter hangs up the phone.
WALTER
Please don't touch anything!
(beat)
Listen, Buddy, have you ever seen a mail room before?
BUDDY
(excited)
A mail room? No.
WALTER
Mail from all over the world gets sorted all in one place! And some of the bins are shiny.
BUDDY
(dreaming)
Shiny...
INT. MAILROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Yelling voices, loud machinery and blaring hip-hop fill the place. YOUNG, URBAN WORKERS in criminal apparel wrap and unwrap massive parcels.
The elevator dings open to reveal Buddy, alone, frightened. The floor manager, CHUCK, spots Buddy.
FLOOR MANAGER
You Buddy?
(Buddy nods)
Well come on out of the elevator then.
BUDDY
Okay.
Floor manager leads Buddy over to the main work area.
FLOOR MANAGER
Welcome to the pit.
TREY, an enormous, bald African-American man and CRAIG, a bald, wiry kid with a neck tattoo, stop their sorting and look up at Buddy with threatening glares.
FLOOR MANAGER
...over here is the trench. All the mail comes out of the shooter. You scan and find the floor each piece is moving to. Put her in the canister and shove her up the tube with the same number, got it?
BUDDY
Yeah! I like tubes and cannisters and numbers. This place reminds me of Santa's workshop. Except here it smells like mushrooms and everyone wants to hurt me.
INT. CONVERENCE ROOM - DAY
It's a writer's meeting. The three writers: EUGENE, HUSKEY and MORRIS sit around a table with Walter.
WALTER
So, we've got Greenway coming in tomorrow. Where are we at?
EUGENE
Well, Huskey and I were brain storming and we came up with what I think is a pretty big idea.
HUSKEY
You're going to love this.
MORRIS
I heard it already and I think it's fantastic.
WALTER
(pleasantly surprised)
Okay, great. Let's hear it.
HUSKEY
Picture this...
(long dramatic pause)
We bring in Miles Finch.
WALTER
The Miles Finch?
EUGENE
(excited)
The Golden Ghost.
HUSKEY
We bring him in.
MORRIS
He's written more classics than Dr. Seuss. It may not be easy, but we think it's worth a shot.
WALTER
So, lemme get this straight. You guys are pitching me the idea of another writer?
EUGENE
Yeah.
HUSKEY
Miles Finch.
Walter looks like he's about to get angry...but then:
WALTER
I like it.
INT. GREENWAY PRESS - MAIL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
This is Buddy at his best. He stuffs and launches mail into tubes with incredible speed and efficiency. No one's ever seen anything like it.
Almost without noticing, Buddy begins singing to himself.
BUDDY
(singing)
On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me...
He feels Trey's stares and catches himself. He turns to find a stone cold killer glare.
TREY
(beat)
A partridge in a pear tree.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Walter and the writers are huddled around a speaker phone.
EUGENE
My favorite book of yours has to be Gus' Pickles. It was existential, yet so accessible.
HUSKEY
It's a thrill just to be talking to you on our speaker phone.
WALTER
So what do you think? Can you fly in tomorrow morning?
A beat, and then Miles Finch's voice comes over the speaker phone, mysterious and brilliant.
MILES FINCH (O.S.)
(intercom)
I'll give you five hours tomorrow, not a minute more.
WALTER
(relieved)
Great.
MILES FINCH (O.S.)
I'd like a black S-500 to receive me at the airport. I need the interior of that car to be 71 degrees.
WALTER
We can do that.
DEB (O.S.)
(over intercom; BEEP!)
Walter! There's a situation downstairs.
MILES FINCH (O.S.)
I'm sorry, what? Hello?
WALTER
(in panic)
Deb, hang up! Miles stay on!
MILES FINCH
I do not hold! Do not put me on hold!
DEB (O.S.)
We have a problem in the mail room.
HUSKEY
What's going on?
WALTER
(pointing to Huskey)
Do not talk!
(into phone)
Deb, please hang up!
MILES FINCH (O.S.)
That's it, I'm gone!
WALTER
MILES! WAIT!
Dramatic pause. Is he gone?
MILES FINCH (O.S.)
I'll be there tomorrow.
(phew!)
71 degrees...
He clicks off.
DEB (O.S.)
Sir, Chuck in the mail room.
WALTER
Okay, okay! I'm going to the stupid mail room!
INT. MAILROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Buddy's singing has spread like wild fire. The whole mailroom is now singing a beautiful rendition of THE TWELVE DAYS OF CHRISTMAS. Everyone is circled around, cheering and singing.
TREY
Eleven-pipers-piping...
CRAIG
Ten-lords-a-leaping...
LAZY-EYED CREEP
Nine-ladies-dancing...
GANG BANGER
Eight-maids-milking...
TREY
Six-geese-a-laying...
EVERYBODY
FIVE GOLDEN RINGS!!!
REVEAL
Walter is watching this display. The workers begin to notice Walter standing. One by one, they stop, until Buddy is left to continue alone.
BUDDY
(as he squat-thrusts)
On the twelfth day of Christmas, my true love...gave...to...
Buddy notices his dad and smiles. Walter does not.
EXT. JOVIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Buddy walks up to the buzzer panel until he finds the name Jovie Davis.
He presses the buzzer BRRR!!!! It scares the hell out of him. He jumps back and is then frightened to death as he is confronted by the sight of a display window full of Chinese roasted ducks. Still sporting heads. Jovie steps out.
BUDDY
(taking her in)
You look miraculous.
JOVIE
Miraculous? Thanks.
(they start walking)
So what do you feel like doing?
BUDDY
I have a few ideas.
JOVIE
Well, I'm up for anything.
BUDDY
Really?
JOVIE
Sure.
INT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT
Jovie sits blind-folded at the counter as Buddy sets up a cup of coffee before her.
BUDDY
Don't look. Just reach out and take a sip.
JOVIE
(smiles)
What are you doing?
She takes a sip.
BUDDY
Well?
JOVIE
It tastes like a crappy cup of coffee.
BUDDY
Ha ha.
He removes the blindfold.
JOVIE
It is a crappy cup of coffee.
EXT. MID-TOWN MANHATTAN - LATER
Buddy is running around and around a revolving door. Loving every moment.
Jovie watches, confused. Smirking slightly as OTHERS wait and grow annoyed with him.
EXT. MANHATTAN - NIGHT
Buddy pulls her by the arm.
BUDDY
Check out the size of this...
He shows her a pine tree decorated for Christmas.
BUDDY
Can you believe it?
JOVIE
(nonplussed)
Come with me.
EXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER - LATER
Jovie leads him around the corner.
REVEAL:
ROCKEFELLER CENTER. Buddy sees the GIANT CHRISTMAS TREE for the first time.
BUDDY
Wow, that looks wondrous.
They share their first genuine smile.
EXT. ICE RINK - LATER
Buddy and Jovie are skating, having fun. Jovie accidentally slides, BUMPING BUDDY. Buddy bumps her back. She bumps him back harder. It escalates until she checks him off of his feet. THEY FALL to the ice together, Jovie on top, nose to nose.
They look into each other's eyes and Buddy abruptly plants a kiss on Jovie's cheek.
BUDDY
Sorry.
JOVIE
You missed.
BUDDY
I missed?
JOVIE
Yeah.
With that, She leans in and kisses him full on the mouth. Buddy's hear fills his whole chest.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NEXT DAY
Walter and the writers sit in silence, waiting. Walter checks his watch. Still waiting.
HUSKEY
I sure hope that car's seventy one degrees.
EXT. MANHATTAN - CONTINUOUS
The door swings open with a purpose:
REVEAL
Buddy. The morning after. Steps into the door frame like ELVIS. A changed man. WE follow him down the street. Buddy's not skipping, he's SKIPPING.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Walter and the writer's continue to wait. Nervous hand wringing.
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
We see only the shoes of the infamous Miles Finch march through the company, echoing throughout the halls.
We see some of the workers' reactions.
This is epic.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
More nervous waiting.
EUGENE
I should have brought my camera.
More silence...and then:
MILES FINCH (O.S.)
Alright. Let's do this.
REVEAL
Miles Finch is FOUR FEET TALL. He may be very small, but in this business, he is a monster.
WALTER
Miles! Thanks so much for coming. We're all big fans. I'm Walter. We spoke on the phone.
MILES FINCH
Yeah, yeah. Great. Let's get the uh --
(i.e. Cash)
Taken care of so we can get started.
Walter pulls out a small manila envelope stacked with cash and slides it across the table. The three other writers watch it slide across, moving their heads like a tennis match, until Miles stops it with his hand.
Miles checks the money and tucks it into his vest pocket.
MILES FINCH
Okay, cool.
(right to the point)
So what have you guys got so far?
WALTER
(to Huskey)
Go ahead.
HUSKEY
(nervous)
Okay, well, we were thinking something like this: we open on a young Tomato. He's been through some tough times on the farm.
MILES FINCH
No tomatoes. Too vulnerable. Kids are already vulnerable.
WALTER
That's what we were kind of thinking.
MILES FINCH
And no farms, everyone's pushing small-town rural. Any farm book will just be white noise.
WALTER
Okay. Well, we don't have much time. Do you have any ideas?
MILES FINCH
I've got five or six strong starts. I'm sure we can put something very solid together. No problem.
(Walter is very happy)
There's one idea I'm especially psyched about. It's one of those ideas where you're just like YES!
WALTER
What is it?!
MILES FINCH
I'll start with the cover, okay? Picture this: A--
BUDDY (O.S.)
Dad!
Walter is still fixated on Miles, waiting for his golden ticket. Finally he snaps out of it and looks at Buddy.
BUDDY
I'm in love! I'm in love! And I don't care who knows it!
WALTER
Not now, Buddy. Why don't you go...uh, back to the pit? I'll come visit you later, okay?
Buddy goes to leave, but before he does, he NOTICES A FOUR FOOT TALL MILES FINCH.
BUDDY
(looking at little Miles)
You didn't tell me you had Elvises working here!
MILES FINCH
(icy stare)
Boy you are hilarious, my friend.
WALTER
So what are you saying, Miles? Let's get back to the book.
MILES FINCH
(back on track)
Okay, at the top of the cover is the title, et this, ready? A --
BUDDY
Boy, the candy canes here in New York just don't measure up to Elf standards, do they?
MILES FINCH
(another icy stare)
Gee whiz, we're all laughing our butts off.
WALTER
Buddy! Please. Just go in the basement!
BUDDY
Do you guys have an Elf hockey league here? I'm just curious.
MILES FINCH
Hey, jack weed. I may be ""little,"" but I get more action in a week than you've had your whole life. I've got houses in LA, Hawaii, Vail and Paris, with a seventy inch plasma screen in each one of them. So I suggest you wipe that friggin' smile off your face before I bite it off.
(leaning in)
You feelin' strong, friend? Call me ELF one more time.
BUDDY
(to his Dad)
Boy, he's an angry Elf.
Miles suddenly ATTACKS! Buddy tries to avoid him, but Miles is surprisingly strong, flipping Buddy over the table.
Now out of nowhere, Buddy winds up like Popeye and decks him across the face. Buddy looks at his own fist in horror.
BUDDY
(looking at his fist)
What have I done?
This gives Miles permission to deliver five QUICK HOCKEY PUNCHES to the face. Buddy is down for the count.
Miles stands, victorious and grabs his coat.
MILES FINCH
All of you can kiss my vertically challenged ass.
Miles takes the envelope of money out of his jacket and pretends to toss it on the table, pump faking. Then returns it to his vest pocket and walks out.
WALTER
Miles! Wait!
BUDDY
(to himself)
A South Pole Elf.
Buddy rubs his chin and stands to face his father.
BUDDY
You're really red.
WALTER
DAMMIT BUDDY! THIS TIME YOU REALLY DID IT! GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!!
BUDDY
(scared)
Where do you want me to go?
WALTER
Go anywhere! I don't care if you're crazy. I don't care if you're an elf!! I don't care if you're my son!!! JUST STAY OUT OF MY LIFE!!!
This one stings hard. Buddy runs off, upset like never before.
EXT. MANHATTAN - LATER
QUICK CUTS
Buddy walking through the city, devastated.
INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - LATER
Walter is stressed, rubbing his face, pulling his hair out, on the phone. He's losing his career, and now he knows he's hurt Buddy.
WALTER
(into phone)
I can't really talk right now.
INT. EMILY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
INTERCUT with Emily.
EM
You're gonna be home for dinner, aren't you? I mean it is Christmas Eve.
WALTER
It looks like it's gonna be a late one.
EM
Oh. Do you wanna send Buddy home early?
WALTER
(riddled with guilt)
Oh, um, we'll talk about it later. I gotta go, okay?
Suddenly the three writers rush in. Walter hangs up.
HUSKEY
Walter! Huge news. The cleaning man just found this!
WALTER
What is it?
Huskey hands over a black journal and Walter flips through it.
HUSKEY
Miles Finch's notebook! He left it in the conference room. There's three great pitches in the first page alone!
MORRIS
Plus we've got his doodle-squiggles all over the back cover! We're not sure what they mean, but they're probably gold!
HUSKEY
I say we o with the first pitch in there! It's a slam dunk!
EUGENE
I agree, a home run.
MORRIS
Monster.
WALTER
How much time do we have?
HUSKEY
Forty-five.
WALTER
Let's get some story boards ready.
INT. HOBBS' APARTMENT - NIGHT
Buddy steps out of the closet...
REVEAL
He's wearing his ELF SUIT again. Never before has an Elf looked so sad.
Buddy sits at the table and unfurls some long paper. He dips a quill pen in to some ink and writes in PERFECT CALLIGRAPHY.
WE HEAR BUDDY'S VOICE AS HE WRITES.
BUDDY (V.O.)
I'm sorry I ruined your lives... And crammed eleven cookies into the VCR. I don't belong here. I don't belong anywhere. I will never forget you. Love, Buddy.
Buddy sets down the scroll, and now, as if sealing it, sets his SNOW GLOBE down on the crease.
Buddy walks out into the night.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
In his Elf Suit, Buddy trudges through the stormy New York night. The wind viciously blows. Buddy walks against it, the snow blowing into him.
INT. HOBBS' APARTMENT - LATER
Michael comes home, carrying a bunch of presents. He looks around the empty house.
MICHAEL
Buddy?
INT. GREENWAY PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
Fulton Greenway and his crew sit at the end of the conference room, looking sharp as a tack. Walter is at the other end, looking even sharper.
GREENWAY
As you know, we need a big launch, fast. To get this company back on track. So, I think I speak for my fellow board members when I say...
(dramatic pause)
This better be good.
Walter smiles, then re-checks his storyboards, beaming.
WALTER
I'm confident, sir. You will not be disappointed.
GREENWAY
Let's hear it.
WALTER
My pleasure. I'll start with the cover, okay? Picture this: A--
MICHAEL (O.S.)
Dad?!
Walter turns.
His son Michael is standing in the room.
WALTER
Michael?
MICHAEL
Buddy left!
WALTER
What?
Michael holds up the calligraphy scroll Buddy wrote. Everyone is confused.
MICHAEL
He wrote this note! He left his snow globe! He's gone!
WALTER
Okay, listen. Let me finish this meeting and we'll figure this out. Okay?
MICHAEL
Finish your meeting?!
(beat)
How'd I know you were going to say that?
Michael turns to leave, furious. Walter is torn...
WALTER
Michael! Wait!
Michael stops in his tracks, giving his dad a chance. Hopeful.
WALTER
(to the board)
Mr. Greenway, we have to reschedule this.
GREENWAY
We don't have time to reschedule! I want to hear the damn thing NOW!
(to Michael)
Son, this has to wait.
WALTER
No it doesn't. We'll do this some other time, Mr. Greenway.
GREENWAY
This isn't happening. You're going to sit in that chair and pitch me a hit friggin' book! NOW!
WALTER
Mr. Greenway, with all due respect, KISS MY ASS!
MICHAEL
Kiss my ass, too!!
INT. GREENWAY PRESS - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Walter and Michael walk down the hall, triumphantly, together.
GREENWAY (O.S.)
(in the distance)
If you walk out, Hobbs, you can never come back to Greenway!
EXT. THE 59TH STREET BRIDGE - NIGHT
Buddy's on the bridge, looking down. Contemplating the worst of all possible conclusions. WAVES crash and churn far below.
EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST - CONTINUOUS
Walter and Michael are walking fast, searching, half-jogging. Losing hope. Where's Buddy?
EXT. 59TH STREET BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
Buddy closes his eyes tight, then looks up, a tear streams down his cheek.
SUDDENLY SOMETHING CATCHES HIS EYE.
A distant point with a glowing trail of smoke. Buddy narrows his eyes to see as the point grows as it approaches. It slowly reveals itself to be SANTA'S SLEIGH!
Tangled with reindeer, fish-tailing, and CRASHING!
BUDDY
Santa?!
EXT. MANHATTAN - MEANWHILE
Walter is facing away from the park, in the sky behind him is the diving sled. Michael sees this all. His face is aglow.
MICHAEL
Oh...My...God!
WALTER
(missing it; turning)
What was that?!
In shock, without a word, Michael takes off running toward the park.
WALTER
What happened?
(running after him)
Michael, wait up!?
EXT. SANTA'S CRASH SIGHT - CONTINUOUS
Buddy, running, frantic, comes upon Santa's SLEIGH in the distance. The reindeer peacefully graze as Santa struggles with the smoking sleigh. The landing looks to have been rough as the sleigh has dug a deep fifty foot long trench in the snow and dirt.
Santa frantically attempts to repair the problem with his head hidden under a hood panel. Smoke rises.
BUDDY
Santa!
Santa jumps out from under the hood clutching a TIRE IRON.
SANTA
Back off slick!!!
He then recognizes him.
SANTA
Buddy?? Is that you?
BUDDY
Are you okay?
SANTA
Boy am I glad to see you. The Claus-o-meter suddenly dropped down to zero. There's almost no Christmas Spirit in New York. The strain was too much, the engine broke free of her mounts. I need an Elf's help.
BUDDY
But I'm not an Elf, Santa. I can't do anything right.
SANTA
Buddy, you're more of an elf than anyone I've ever met, and the only one who I would have working on my sleight.
BUDDY
Really?
SANTA
Really. Will you fix the engine for me, Buddy?
BUDDY
I will. Papa taught me how.
SANTA
You'll have to find it first, she dropped off back there a ways.
Buddy runs off into the woods.
INT. JOVIE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
Jovie walks out of the kitchen as NEW YORK ONE drones quietly on the TV. IT features a breaking NEWS STORY set in CENTRAL PARK. A REMOTE REPORTER is on the scene.
REMOTE REPORTER
New York One has been unable to confirm anything, but it's obvious that something has happened in Central Park. Authorities are clearing out the park and all entrances have been barricaded. As you can see, quite a crowd is starting to gather.
The camera pans and we see a huge crowd is gathering outside Central Park, held back by barricades and police.
The female reporter steps over to a Latino man, who holds his 5-year old son in his arms.
REMOTE REPORTER
Sir, you say you were able to get a first-hand look at what happened? Tell me, what did you see?
LATINO MAN
I was walking along, and I saw a huge flash, and then something came swooping down...
REMOTE REPORTER
Something? Do you mean an airplane or a helicopter?
LATINO MAN
It wasn't like that. IT sounds crazy, but it looked like, uh...
He's too embarrassed.
LATINO CHILD
It was Santa's Sleigh!
REMOTE REPORTER
(dismissive)
Aren't you a cutie.
(listening to earpiece)
This could be a big hoax. I'm now told we have some amateur footage of a strange man dressed as an Elf. Let's take a look.
ON THE SCREEN
A zoomed-in blurry image of Buddy running. He trips and falls on his face like an idiot. Then scrambles up and runs into the woods. Sort of like that old Big Foot Footage, if he had done a face plant. It ends in a freeze frame of Buddy's FACE as he looks over a shoulder.
They re-play the footage over and over and over again.
JOVIE
(seeing Buddy)
Oh my God.
EXT. ENGINE SITE - CENTRAL PARK -
CONTINUOUS
Walter and Michael stop at a smoking object in the snow. It's SANTA'S MISSING ENGINE.
WALTER
What the...
BUDDY (O.S.)
You found it!
Michael and Walter look up to see Buddy approaching them. Michael runs to him with a hug.
MICHAEL
Buddy! You're here!
BUDDY
(in a hurry)
There's something I've got to tell you guys!
WALTER
(ignoring; focused)
No. Me first. There's something I want to tell you right now! I take back everything I said. You may be a little...how do you say... chemically imbalanced. But you've been right about a lot of things. I promise you, I'm going to be making some changes in my life. I don't want you to leave... I need you. You're my son and I love you.
They hug. This means more Buddy than anyone could ever know.
SANTA (O.S.)
(from a foggy distance)
Buddy?! How are we looking?? We gotta move!
WALTER
Who was that?
EXT. SANTA'S CRASH SITE - CONTINUOUS
Buddy leads them to the clearing. Pulling back a tree branch to reveal:
TRUTH
Santa's GROUNDED SLEIGH and nine grazing reindeer. Shocked awe.
MICHAEL
(can barely speak)
Cool...
Walter cannot yet deal with this reality. His eyes getting wider and wider...about to faint?
TV COVERAGE - CONTINUOUS
REMOTE REPORTER
Dick, according to authorities, the area has been cleared. Only the Central Park Rangers remain in the park.
EXT. BELVEDERE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS
TRACKING CLOSE UP OF HOOVES
All lined up along a ridge. FOUR BLACK MARES breathe steam into the night air. Their RIDERS are silently staring into the night. They wear black leather boots and trench coats.
Chrome helmets sit atop faces shrouded in shadow. A silver eagle badge reads CENTRAL PARK RANGERS. They look down upon the sleigh, quite a distance away.
REMOTE REPORTER (V.O.)
These forces are highly trained, but rarely see action. Some have accused them of being too ""gung ho"" when called into duty. And their crowd control tactics at the Simon and Garfunkel concert in '85 were much criticized.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
JOVIE IS RUNNING down the street, heading into Central Park.
EXT. GREAT LAWN - CONTINUOUS
Buddy works on the engine while Walter and Michael try to wake up from this strange dream.
MICHAEL
So...you're...real?
SANTA
(re: sleigh; working)
Hold this for a sec.
WALTER
This is not happening.
Walter and Michael, stunned, hold the hood up.
MICHAEL
Buddy's really an Elf?
BUDDY
Actually, I'm adopted.
MICHAEL
I can't believe it.
SANTA
Tell me, what did you want for Christmas, Michael?
MICHAEL
I wanted a skateboard.
Santa pulls out a scroll. He points to his name in calligraphy on a THICK LEATHER-BOUND BOOK.
It's THE LIST.
SANTA
(verifying)
Not just a skateboard, a Real Huf Board with high 145 Thunder Trucks. 52 millimeter Spitfire Classic Wheels and bolts from Diamond and some Swiss Bearings.
In this moment, Walter and Michael both really believe.
ECU
We see the CLAUS-O-METER move up a little.
The sleigh SHUDDERS and RISES, then falls to the ground.
MICHAEL
What happened?
SANTA
Before our Viper engine days, this thing used to run solely on Christmas Spirit. You two believe in me. You made my sleigh fly.
MICHAEL
They fly away! Quick! Before they catch you!
SANTA
I wish I could. I'm afraid I need more than the Spirit of just you two.
MICHAEL
Hold it. If you're really Santa, we can just get the news cameras in here and everyone will believe in you, then your sleigh will fly, right?
SANTA
Christmas Spirit is about believing, not seeing. If the whole world saw me, all would be lost. The paparazzi have been after me for years.
Michael spots the RANGERS on the crest in the distance.
MICHAEL
Look!
They all look up in fear as the riders disappear into the woods. Buddy pulls Walter aside. Michael follows.
BUDDY
Santa needs your help.
MICHAEL
But, what can we do?
BUDDY
I got an idea.
He whispers a PLAN to Walter and Michael.
CUT TO:
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - CONTINUOUS
The Rangers gallop through the darkness of the woods toward the sleigh.
CUT TO:
EXT. GREAT LAWN - CONTINUOUS
Michael SNATCHES the LIST from Santa and runs into the woods.
SANTA
My List!
Buddy stops Santa from chasing. He takes command.
BUDDY
Santa, let him go. You'll get it back. Now, listen to me. I need you to give Walter your hat and coat.
SANTA
But Mrs. Claus made them for me...
WALTER
Hurry! Do you have any idea what would happen to Santa Clause in prison?!
Santa complies and Walter dons the over-sized ensemble.
CUT TO:
EXT. BARRICADES - CONTINUOUS
REMOTE REPORTER spots Michael running out of the trees.
REMOTE REPORTER
A young boy has just come running out of the park...Let me see if I can get a comment...
(to Michael)
Did you see anything?
MICHAEL
It's the real Santa! His sleigh can't fly cause nobody believes in him!
REMOTE REPORTER
(blowing him off)
Now, this is feeling more and more like some kind of elaborate Christmas hoax.
MICHAEL
This isn't a stunt. It's true! Everyone out there, Santa needs us to believe! I can prove he's real. This is Santa's LIST!
He pulls out the LIST and reads:
MICHAEL
Lynn Kessler wants a Powerpuff Girls play set! Mark Webber wants an electric guitar!
SERIES OF CUTS TO:
Lynn and Mark. Each with their eyes wide open, believing, giving Santa power.
INT. HOBBS' APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
Emily still in her coat with groceries is watching Michael on TV in the apartment.
EMILY
Michael!
CUT TO:
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - CONTINUOUS
Michael reads the list into the camera.
MICHAEL
Stan Tobias wants a powerpumper water rifle. Carolyn Reynolds wants a Suzie-Talks-A-Lot...
SERIES OF CUTS TO:
Carolyn, the girl from the Doctor's office, at home watching on TV.
CAROLYN
Thank you, Buddy!
MICHAEL
Dirk Lawson wants a day of pampering at Burke-Williams spa.
WE CUT TO:
A ROUGH-LOOKING BIKER, 35, in a bar. His biker friends all look at him.
BIKER
Must be another Dirk Lawson...
EXT. BARRICADE - CONTINUOUS
MICHAEL
Dave Keckler wants some Pony High Tops!
EXT. BARRICADE - CONTINUOUS
The female Remote Reporter attempts to step in.
REMOTE REPORTER
That's quite enough little fella.
MICHAEL
What's your name?
REMOTE REPORTER
(smiling)
I'm Charlotte Dennon.
MICHAEL
Lemme see. Charlotte Dennon wants a ""Tiffany engagement ring, and for your boyfriend to stop dragging his feet and commit already!""
Off the Reporter's look, we...
SMASH CUT TO:
The SURGE IN CHRISTMAS SPIRIT makes Santa's Sleigh RISE A FOOT OFF THE GROUND. We see the gauge go forward a bit.
SANTA
We got power!
Santa snaps the reigns. The sleigh starts to lumber forward. Buddy still struggles with the engine under the sleigh.
BUDDY
I don't have the engine fixed yet!
EXT. BARRICADE - CONTINUOUS
The reporter stands speechless as the ANCHORMAN talks into her earpiece...
INT. NEW YORK ONE STUDIO - CONTINUOUS
The Anchorman is confused.
ANCHORMAN
Charlotte? Charlotte? We seem to be having some technical difficulty with our remote unit. Now for weather on the ones...
EXT. BARRICADE - CONTINUOUS
The Reporter stands staring at Michael as the lights are TURNED OFF on the remote unit.
MICHAEL
No!
REMOTE REPORTER
(stunned)
How did you know that?
MICHAEL
I'm telling you, it's Santa! We have to get the cameras back on! He needs our help!
This giant scene at the barricades has gone dark. The crowd offers scattered boos. Emily consoles Michael.
CROWD (O.S.)
Let the kid read! What do I want?!
The crowd stands around, confused. Jovie runs up to Michael and Emily, winded.
JOVIE
Where's Buddy?!
MICHAEL
He's with Santa. The sleigh won't fly. No one's believing! We need to get these cameras back on!
Jovie looks around. Trying to think of a plan. Inspired, she climbs atop a horse's carriage and looks out over the crowd. She's intimidated.
JOVIE
(to herself)
The best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear...
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - CONTINUOUS
Walter, standing watch, sees the MOUNTED POLICE CHARGING.
WALTER
Get out of here! They're coming! There's enough Christmas spirit to start moving!
Buddy jumps in. The sleigh slowly hovers forward a foot off the ground, in a herky-jerky way. The MOUNTED RIDERS come at Walter who wears Santa's hat and coat. He attempts to be a decoy.
WALTER
Hey! I'm right here! Ho ho ho! You got me! I surrender!
They ride right past him and after the sleigh.
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - CONTINUOUS
Buddy and Santa swerve past trees, scraping bark and smashing branches. Santa catches a glimpse over his shoulder of the Rangers in hot pursuit.
SANTA
Grab the shot gun under the seat and give 'em some heat!
BUDDY
What?!
SANTA
A joke, Buddy. Lighten up! Listen, there's barely enough magic to make this thing move. Keep working on the engine!
EXT. BARRICADE - CONTINUOUS
Above the huge crowd that has gathered at the barricade, we see Jovie standing on top of a car roof. Timidly, she begins singing, her sweet voice cracking with fear.
JOVIE
You better watch out, you better not cry, you better not pout. I'm telling you why...
Walter finally arrives. He joins his family, watching Jovie.
WALTER
(to Emily)
He wasn't lying.
EMILY
Merry Christmas.
They hug.
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - CONTINUOUS
Buddy, risking his life, working on the engine at high speed. Smoke and sparks billow out. Santa struggles to maintain control. They hit a bump and some toys fly out of the back.
A Jack in the Box rattles by Buddy, POPPING OPEN.
BUDDY
Ah!
They find themselves blocked by a giant FOUNTAIN with the Rangers close behind.
BUDDY
I've almost got it!
SANTA
We need power, now!
Buddy tweaks the engine. It HOWLS TO LIFE and the urge of power BLOWS THE SLEIGH FORTY FEET INTO THE AIR, clearing the fountain.
BUDDY
(in triumph)
YES!! I DID IT!! I'M THE GREATEST ADOPTED ELF IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD!
SANTA
Good job, Buddy!
But now the belly of the coach nails the winged statue atop the fountain, yanking the whole engine back out of the sleigh. YOINK! The machine whirls and shoots off the trees. The engineless sleigh crashes down to the bricks.
SANTA
That's it. With no engine, we're toast.
CUT TO:
EXT. BARRICADE - CONTINUOUS
JOVIE
He sees you when you're sleeping...
Emily is the first to join in. And now Michael sings too. And now some others...
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - CONTINUOUS
Still with some Spirit power, the sleigh scrapes along the paved mall, sending sparks showering into the night air as the horses close in.
EXT. BARRICADE - CONTINUOUS
The WHOLE CROWD sings. The Remote Reporter sees this and puts her finger to her earpiece.
REMOTE REPORTER
(to the studio)
Dick, come back to remote 3. I think I've got something here.
JOVIE & THE CROWD
He knows if you've been bad or good, so be good for goodness sake...
CAMERAS TURN BACK ON.
REMOTE TRUCK'S LIGHTS POP BACK ON. Again, the scene is aglow.
REMOTE REPORTER
(into cameras)
Charlotte Dennon, back at Central Park. Although we're still unclear about what led to this holiday rally, hundreds of New Yorkers have spontaneously gathered together and broken out into song. A curious Christmas Eve, to say the least. Let's listen in...
BRIEF CUTS AROUND THE CITY
The Broadcast is being watched...
- We see the MAILROOM guys in A bar singing along in perfect harmony.
- the THREE WRITERS are singing.
- the DOCTOR is singing.
- the GUARDS from the Empire State Building are singing.
- the TEENAGERS who threw snowballs sing.
- the ELF MANAGER from Gimbels sings with co-workers.
ELF MANAGER
(as his friends sing)
Do what you want, I ain't singing a damn thing.
EXT. THE MOVING SLEIGH - CONTINUOUS
Santa's sleigh is being rail-roaded. Right into the barricades. No steering, no lift...up in the distance, we see they are headed for a collision.
EXT. BARRICADE - CONTINUOUS
As Emily and Michael sing along, Michael looks up at Walter and notices something peculiar. He busts his father.
MICHAEL
Wait! You're NOT singing!
WALTER
Yes I am.
MICHAEL
No you're not. You're just moving your lips.
WALTER
Michael! Please, I have a terrible voice.
MICHAEL
Dad!!!
Then, in spite of himself, WALTER BELTS OUT THE CHORUS in such an awful voice, it draws looks from the singers around him. As the bad notes rise into the chilly night air...
WALTER
(terrible)
Santa Claus is coming to town!
EXT. THE MOVING SLEIGH - CONTINUOUS
Walter's singing somehow does the trick. The CLAUS-O-METER shoots to the MAX!
A dash light BLINKS ""HO HO HO"" as the gauge hits the red zone. Santa howls in approval. The SLEIGH flies up into the night air and over the barricade, reporters and on-lookers. The rangers slide to a stop, foiled at last.
As the shadow of the sleigh zips high over them, the whole crowd joins in, singing their hearts out. Jovie can't believe it. She sings even stronger.
A VOICE BOOMS OUT from a mysterious silhouette into the magical winter night...
SANTA
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas!
Santa's sleigh whips down Sixth Ave. and into the Manhattan night sky. And silhouettes against the moon.
FREEZE FRAME
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
And so, with a little help, Buddy managed to save Christmas.
INT. HOBBS' APARTMENT - CHRISTMAS DAY
Walter, Michael, Buddy, Emily and Jovie sit happily gathered around their Christmas tree. Wrapping paper everywhere.
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
And his spirit saved a lot of other people, too. It was quite a Christmas, and quite a New Year.
INT. WALTER'S NEW COMPANY - DAY
Walter is stenciling the name 'HOBB'S PUBLISHING'.
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
Walter started his own independent publishing company. His first book was written by a brand new critically acclaimed children's author...
INT. GIMBELS - DAY
The 'ELF' book from the beginning of the movie is Buddy's. He's doing a book signing. The place is packed.
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
The book was called 'Elf'. A fictional story about an adopted Elf named Buddy who was raised in the North Pole. Went to New York, ate spaghetti, worked in a shiny mail room and eventually saved Christmas.
Buddy and Walter ice skate together at Rockefeller Center in the middle of the night.
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
And every year, on Christmas day, after all the presents are opened by children around the world, Buddy and his Dad make up for lost time...
Buddy still tries to hold his hand. Walter slaps it away.
INSERT
We see an Elfish hand applying white out to Walter's name on the List.
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
Walter even made the jump from 'naughty' to 'nice'.
INT. PAPA'S WORKSHOP - DAY
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
And, as for me, I can't complain. Buddy comes up to visit from time to time.
RAPID FIRE FINALE OF BUDDY SLAMMING HIS HEAD INTO DOORWAYS, BEAMS AND CABINETS.
BUDDY
Ow! Yikes! Golly! Charles Dickens! Sone of a Gnome! Fiddlesticks! Snow Flickers!
INT. PAPA ELF'S WORKSHOP - DAY
Jovie, in real Elf clothes, sets a pitcher of milk in front of Papa Elf. She sits beside Buddy who cradles a NEWBORN BABY in his arms wearing a pink Elf hat that says SUSIE.
This is the last image of the movie and also the last image of the book. It freezes and now becomes a drawing and we pull out to see it's the last page of Buddy's ELF book, which magically flips closed.
We're back in the bookstore from the very first scene. A little kid grabs the book out of the window.
FADE TO BLACK.

What was never meant to be

Washes away the tears
And all the pain
Only after the rain
Can you live again
I know the emptiness
You feel inside
You're thinking if you break away
You'll never survive

Bamboo earrings, at least two pair
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude
That's all I need to get me in a good mood
She can walk with a switch and talk with street slang
I love it when a woman ain't scared to do her thing
Standing at the bus stop sucking on a lollipop
Once she gets pumping its hard to make the hottie stop
She likes to dance to the rap jams
She sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams
Honey coated complexion, using Camay
Let's hear it for the girl, she's from around the way

I need an around the way, girl
Around the way, girl
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
I need an around the way, girl
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving

Silky, milky, her smile is like sunshine
That's why I had to dedicate at least one rhyme
To all the cuties in the neighborhood
'Cause if I didn't tell you then another brother would
You're sweet like sugar with your gangster talk
Want to eat you like a cookie when I see you walk
With your rayon, silk or maybe even denim
It really doesn't matter as long as you're in 'em
You can break hearts and manipulate minds
Or surrender act tender be gentle and kind
You always know what to say and do
Cold flip when you think your man is playing you
Not cheap or petty, you're ready for loving
You're real independent so your parents be bugging
But if you ever need a place to stay
Come around my way

I need an around the way, girl
Around the way, girl
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me (to the bridge)
I need an around the way, girl
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving

Perm in your hair or even a curly weave
Witcha New Edition Bobby Brown button on your sleeve
I tell you come here, you say meet me half way
'Cause brothers been popping that game all day
Around the way you're like a neighborhood jewel
All the homeboys sweat you so you're crazy cool
Wear your gold in the summer with your biking shorts
While you watching all the brothers on the basketball court
Going to the movies with your homegirl's crew
While the businessmen in suits be hawking you
Baby hair pumping, lip gloss is shining
I think you in the mood for wining and dining
So we can go out and eat somewhere
We got a lot of private jokes to share
Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee
I love you, you're from around the way

I need an around the way, girl
Around the way, girl
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
I need an around the way, girl
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
I need an around the way, girl
Around the way, girl
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
I need an around the way, girl
I'm asking you

You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
You got me shook up, shook down
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
You got me shook up, shook down
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
You got me shook up, shook down
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
You got me shook up, shook down"

What are we gonna do with it
Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it

One two, tell me what you got
Let me slip my quarters inside your slot to hit the jackpot
Rev me up, rev me up my little buttercup
We can tug sheets snuggle up and get stuck
Believe it or not, here comes the brother with glow
A strugglin', bubblin' overweight lover hug pro
So what's it gonna be, me or the TV
Now let me take time to set your mind and your body free
So why don't you just stretch stretch for a sec
Lay down your problems so I can cop a quick wreck
Shake me, shake me baby Baby bake me
No need to fake here I am come on and take me
Wind your body baby move your body
I see you slip sliding come on and do it hottie
I'm not quite sure as to what is going down
But I'm feeling hunky‚Äìdory about this thing that I found

Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it
Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it

I like the way you wiggle you don't jingle, but you jiggle
So spread open your love cause it's Heavy in the middle
Move it like a mover she wanted to groove so I grooved her
Then she wanted to learn so we played school and I schooled her
(Mary had a little lamb) But not like this
We can toss and turn, rumble, tumble and twist
Anything you want, I'll give it fantasies we'll live it
So lay down and relax, lover, my lady
Lady lover, my baby girl
Spread your wings so we can fly around the world
Harmony, charming me your fingertips are calming me
When you dropped the kisses, Suzie Q, you dropped the bomb on me
Stretch it, stretch it, flex it, flex it
Gimme the permission okey-dokey I'll bless it
Bless it like buddha, buddha has to bless
We can lay down after loving put your head on my chest

Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it
Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it

What can we do what are we gonna do
Roses are red and violets are blue
Love is good and plenty if you get plenty good lovin'
Kiss you where you're hot give what I got to keep you bubblin'
Do me right, do me right my lonesome dove
Tell ya man one time what is this thing called love
I'm not quite sure as to what is going down
But I'm feelin' hunky‚Äìdory about this thing I found

Now that we found love

Here we go, keep it funky
Put your hands together, y'all come on
Bring it back one time
All up in money earning Mount Vernon
This one's dedicated to you
Know what I'm saying
Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, Manhattan
The whole New York City
I said I love ya to death
And ya don't stop
Ya don't quit, ya gotta keep on
Until the d-d-do it like this

Ya gotta keep on and on and on

In the hopes that there's a Heaven
And everyday I'm more confused
As the saints turn into sinners

All the heroes and legends
I knew as a child have fallen to idols of clay
And I feel this empty place inside
So afraid that I've lost my faith

Show me the way, show me the way
Take me tonight to the river
And wash my illusions away
Please show me the way

And as I slowly drift to sleep
For a moment dreams are sacred
I close my eyes and know there's peace
In a world so filled with hatred

That I wake up each morning and turn on the news
To find we've so far to go
And I keep on hoping for a sign
So afraid I just won't know

Show me the way, show me the way
Bring me tonight to the mountain
And take my confusion away
And show me the way

And if I see a light, should I believe
Tell me how will I know

Show me the way, show me the way
Take me tonight to the river
And wash my illusions away
Show me the way, show me the way
Give me the strength and the courage
To believe that I'll get there someday
And please show me the way

I can't escape the pain inside
Because love takes time

I don't wanna be here alone

Losing my mind
From this hollow in my heart
Suddenly, I'm so incomplete
Lord, I need you now
Tell me how to stop the rain
Tears are falling down endlessly

You might say that you don't care
You might say you don't miss me
You don't need me

Why must we never break down and cry?

You can't watch No You can't eat You ain't supposed to be here
And the sign says ""You got to have a membership card to get inside"" Huh
And the sign says ""Everybody welcome Come in Kneel down and pray""
But then they passed around a plate at the end of it all
And I didn't have a penny to pay
So I got me a pen and paper And I made up my own little sign
I said Thank you Lord for thinking about me I'm alive and doing fine
Signs Signs
Everywhere there's signs
Fucking up the scenery
Breaking my mind
Do this, don't do that
Can't you read the sign

Is all I can do
Dream of the good times
That we never knew
No late nights alone in your arms
I'll dream on
Living in wonder
Thinking of you
Still looking for ways to uncover the truth
You're so young is all they can say
They don't know
If I could change the way of the world
I'd be your girl

Too many walls
Have been built in between us
Too many dreams
Have been shattered around us
If I seem to give up
They'll still never win
Deep in my heart
I know the strength is within

Watching the others
Chances drift by
They'll never discover these feelings I hide
Deep inside
I'm falling apart
All alone with a broken heart
Thinking in silence
Is all they allow
These words still unspoken may never be found
All these dreams one day will be mine
They cross my mind
My time has yet to come
Until then

Too many walls
Have been built in between us
Too many dreams
Have been shattered around us
If I seem to give up
They'll still never win
Deep in my heart
I know the strength is within
Ooh, yeah

Too many walls
Have been built in between us
Too many dreams
Have been shattered around us
If I seem to give up
They'll still never win
Deep in my heart
I know the strength is within
Too many walls
Have been built in between us
Too many dreams
Have been shattered around us
If I seem to give up
They'll still never win
Deep in my heart
I know the strength is within"

Cries a suicidal Vietnam vet
Who fought a losing war on a foreign shore
To find his country didn't want him back
Their bullets took his best friend in Saigon
Our lawyers took his wife and kids, no regrets
In a time I don't remember
In a war he can't forget
He cried ""Forgive me for what I've done there
Cause I never meant the things I did""

And give me something to believe in

My best friend died a lonely man
In some Palm Springs hotel room
I got the call last Christmas Eve
And they told me the news
I tried all night not to break down and cry
As the tears rolled down my face
I felt so cold and empty
Like a lost soul out of place
And the mirror, mirror on the wall
Sees my smile it fades again

And give me something to believe in (and give me something to believe in)
If there's a Lord above
And give me something to believe in (and give me something to believe in)
Oh, Lord arise

Sometimes I wish to God I didn't know now
The things I didn't know then
Road, you gotta take me home

I drive by the homeless sleeping on
A cold dark street
Like bodies in an open grave
Underneath the broken old neon sign
That used to read
Jesus Saves
A mile away live the rich folks
And I see how they're living it up
While the poor they eat from hand to mouth
The rich is drinkin' from a golden cup
And it just makes me wonder
Why so many lose, so few win

And give me something to believe in
And give me something to believe in, if there's a Lord above
And give me something to believe in, oh Lord arise

But don't you ask me to give it back
I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me
I'm not in love, I'm not in love"

Seguro que han o√≠do que yo soy educado
Soy un caballerito un chico bien portado
Un joven responsible y siempre bien vestido
Yo no se quien ha mentido
I don't drink or smoke ain't into dope
Won't try no coke, ask me how I do it, I cope
My only addiction has to do with the female species
I eat 'em raw like sushi
No me gustan ternos, mi estilo es moderno
Si me enterno, you me enfermo
Mi apariencia es dura, vivo en la locura
No me vengan con ternuras
So please don't judge a book by its cover
There's more to being a latin lover
You got to know how to deal with a woman that won't let go
The price you pay for being a gigolo
Rico...
Suave...
There's not a woman that can handle
A man like me
That's why I juggle two or three
I ain't one to commit, you can omit that bit
You pop the question that's it
A ver: uno, dos, tres, cuatro mujeres
Y la situaci√≥n ah√≠ no muere
No es un delito calmo mi apetito
Con un llanto o un grito
So again don't let my lyrics mislead you
I don't love you but I need you
Would you rather have me lie
Take a piece of your pie and say bye
Or be honest and rub your thighs
Rico...
Suave...
Well, it's ten o'clock and I'm two hours late
I never said I was a prompt date
But you kept persisting that I meet your parents
Huh, they're going to love my appearance
Ding dong el timbre suena
Tu madre abre, qu√© vieja m√°s buena
Le digo ¬°Hola! Pero no para bola
Que se ha creido vieja chola
Go and serve the food mom
Que tengo hambre
If you don't hurry, me va a dar un calambre
Y usted se√±or? Why's your chin on the floor?
Sierra la boca por favor
What's this amor, these little huevos?
Esto s?que yo no pruebo

2692,92,All This Time,Sting,1991,all this time,sting, NA ,1.0,1,"I looked out across the river today
Saw a city in the fog and an old church town where the seagulls play
Saw the sad shire horses walking home in the sodium light
Two priests on the ferry
October geese on a cold winter's night

All this time the river flowed
Endlessly to the sea

Two priests came 'round our house tonight
One young, one old, to offer prayers for the dying to serve the final rite
One to learn, one to teach which way the cold wind blows
And fussing and flapping in priestly black like a murder of crows

All this time the river flowed
Endlessly to the sea
If I had my way
I'd take a boat from the river
And I'd bury the old man
I'd bury him at sea

Blessed are the poor, for they shall inherit the earth
Better to be poor than be a fat man in the eye of the needle
As these words were spoken I swear I hear the old man laughing
What good is a used up world and how could it be worth having?
All this time the river flowed
Endlessly like a silent tear
All this time the river flowed
Father, if Jesus exists then how come he never lives here?

Teachers told the Romans built this place
They built a wall and a temple and an edge of the empire garrison town
They lived and they died
They prayed to their gods, but the stone gods did not make a sound
And their empire crumbles 'till all that was left
Were the stones the workmen found

All this time the river flowed
In the falling light of a Northern sun
If I had my way, take a boat from the river
Men go crazy in congregations, they only get better one by one
One by one"

Dave, drop a load on 'em!

O.P.P., how can I explain it? I'll take it, frame by frame it
To have y'all all jumpin', shoutin', sayin' it
O is for ""other,"" P is for ""peoples',"" scratch your temple
The last P, well, that's not that simple
It's sort of like, well, another way to call a cat a kitten (Uh)
It's five little letters that are missin' here (Uh)
You get on occasion if the other party isn't gamin'(Uh)
It seems I gotta start the explainin', bust it (Uh)
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello (Uh)
You get her name and number (Uh)
And then left feelin' real mellow (Uh)
You get home, wait a day (Uh)
She's what you wanna know about, then you call up (Uh)
And it‚Äôs her girlfriend‚Äôs or her cousin‚Äôs house?! (Uh)
It‚Äôs not a front, a F to the R to the O to the N to the T;
It's just her boyfriend's at her house
(Oh, that‚Äôs why she‚Äôs scary)
It's O.P.P., time other people's what you get it
There's no room for relationship, there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at (Uh)
Who think it's wrong 'cause I was splittin' and co-hittin' that (Uh)
Well, if you do, that's O.P.P. and you're not down with it (Uh)
But if you don't, here's your membership (Uh)

You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
Who‚Äôs down with O.P.P.? (Every last homie!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
Who‚Äôs down with O.P.P.? (All the homies!)

Well, for the ladies O.P.P. means somethin' gifted
The first two letters' the same
But the last is somethin' different
It's the longest, loveliest, lean, I call it the leanest
It's another five-letter word
Rhymin' with ""cleanness"" or ""meanness""
I won't get into that, I'll do it ah sorta properly (Uh)
I'll say the last P, hmmm, stands for ""property"" (Uh)
Now lady, here comes a kiss (Uh)
Blow a kiss back to me, now tell me exactly (Aah)
Have you ever known a brother
Who had another, like, a girl or wife
And you just had to stop a toast
'Cause he looked just that nice? (Uh)
You looked at him, he looked at you
And you knew right away
He had someone but he was gonna be yours anyway! (Uh)
You couldn't be seen with him at all and still you didn't care
'Cause in a room behind a door no one but y'all are there
When y'all are finished, y'all can leave
And only y'all would know; and then y'all could throw that skeleton bone right in the closet do' (Uh)
Now don't be shy
'Cause if you're down I want your hands up high
Say O.P.P. (O.P.P.!) I like to say with pride
Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
You're now down with a discount

You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
Who‚Äôs down with O.P.P.? (Every last lady!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
Who‚Äôs down with O.P.P.? (All the ladies!)

A scab tried to O.P.P. me, I had a girl and she knew that (Uh)
Matter of fact, her and my girl was partners that (Uh)
Had a fall-out, disagreement, yeah, an argument (Uh)
She tried to do me, so we did it in my apartment (Uh)
Bust it! That wasn't the thing (Uh)
It must've been the way she hit the ceiling, 'cause after that she kept on comin' back and catchin' feelings (Uh)
I said: ""Let's go, my girl is comin', so you gotta leave."" (Uh)
She said: ""Oh no, I love you, Treach!""
I said: ""Now child, please! You got to leave
Come grab your coat, right now you gotta go!""
I said: ""Now look you chooses stairs or choose the stair window
This was a fling, a little thing
You shouldn't have brought your heart
'Cause you know I was OPP, hell, from the very start!""
Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about
When you get down, you can't go 'round
Runnin' off at the mouth
That's rule number one in this O.P.P. establishment
You keep yo' mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him!
Excitin', isn't it? A special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta O.P.P. messin' with
Him or her, for sure ain't goin' to admit it
When O.P.P. comes, damn skippy, I'm with it

You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
Who‚Äôs down with O.P.P.? (This whole party!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
Who‚Äôs down with O.P.P.? (This whole party!)"

I will not give you up
Gotta have some faith in the sound
It's the one good thing that I've got
I won't let you down
So please don't give me up
Because I would really, really love to stick around

Heaven knows I was just a young boy
Didn't know what I wanted to be
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me
To win the race, a prettier face
Brand new clothes and a big fat place
On your rock and roll TV
But today the way I play the game is not the same, no way
Think I'm gonna get me some happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I told you so
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone else I've got to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Take back your singing in the rain
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me
Freedom
I won't let you down, freedom
I will not give you up, freedom
Gotta have some faith in the sound
You got to give what you take
It's the one good thing that I've got, freedom
I won't let you down, freedom
So please don't give me up, freedom
Cause I would really, really love to stick around

Heaven knows we sure had some fun, boy
What a kick, just a buddy and me
We had every big-shot goodtime band on the run, boy
We were living in a fantasy
We won the race, got out of the place
Went back home, got a brand new face for the boys on MTV
But today the way I play the game has got to change oh yeah
Now I'm gonna get myself happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I stopped the show
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone I forgot to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Don‚Äôt think that I‚Äôll be back again
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me
Freedom
I won't let you down, freedom
I will not give you up, freedom
Gotta have some faith in the sound
You got to give what you take
It's the one good thing that I've got, freedom
I won't let you down, freedom
So please don't give me up, freedom
Cause I would really, really love to stick around

Well it looks like the road to heaven
But it feels like the road to hell
When I knew which side my bread was buttered
I took the knife as well
Posing for another picture
Everybody's got to sell
But when you shake your ass
They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last
That's what you get
I say that's what you get
That's what you get for changing your mind
And after all this time
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me
Freedom
I won't let you down, freedom
I will not give you up, freedom
Gotta have some faith in the sound
You got to give what you take
It's the one good thing that I've got, freedom
I won't let you down, freedom
So please don't give me up, freedom
Cause I would really, really love to stick around

I'll hold on to my freedom
May not be what you want from me
Just the way it's got to be
Lose the face now
I've got to live"

How inside your eyes I see my destiny
Every time we kiss
I feel you breathe your love so deep inside of me
If the moon and stars should fall
They'd be easy to replace
I would lift you up to heaven
And you would take their place
Then I saw red
When I opened up the door
I saw red
My heart just spilled onto the floor
And I didn't need to see his face
I saw yours
I saw red and then I closed the door
I don't think I'm gonna love you anymore
Everyday I wake up
I thank God that you are still a part of me
We've opened up the door to which
So many people never find the key
And if the sun should ever fail to send its light
We would burn a thousand candles
And make everything alright
Then I saw red
When I opened up the door
I saw red
My heart just spilled onto the floor
And I didn't need to see his face
I saw yours
I saw red and then I closed the door
I don't think I'm gonna love you anymore
I've been hurt and I've been blind
I'm not sure that I'll be fine
I never thought it would end this way
'Cause I saw red
When I opened up the door
I saw red
My heart just spilled onto the floor
And I didn't need to see his face
I saw yours
I saw red and then I closed the door
I don't think I'm gonna love you anymore
Ooh it must be magic"

Some times, just for a moment
I reach out; hope you're still there
Miles away
No; you're never turnin' back
I just can't wait anymore
Miles away
Nothin' left of what we had
Just when I needed you most...
You were miles away...
It's hard to tell, what you're goin' through
You kept your feelings locked inside of you
Open your heart, and chances are
What you're feelin', I'm feelin' too
If only, just for a moment
Hold on, to the dreams that we had
Miles away
No; you're never turnin' back
I just can't wait anymore
Miles away
Nothin' left of what we had
Just when I needed you most
You were miles away
When times were tough, and you were down and out
Who was there by your side?
Now you've gone; I'm so tired of bein' alone..
With only your promises...
Lonliness just fades away
Thoughts of you; just memories
No cryin' now, for what we're missin'
Time won't forget what you meant to me
Hold me, just for a moment
Hold on, to the dreams that we had
Miles away
No; you're never turnin' back
I just can't wait anymore
Miles away
Nothin' left of what we had
Just when I needed you most, whoa-oh

Album:  Blacks' Magic
Song:   Do You Want Me
You said it loud, and I heard you
Never tried to hurt you
Some say I'm old-fashioned
I like to take my time and do it slow
You know with the flow
But don't try to rush it
So ride it like a horse
And let nature take its course
Get to know each other
Be my friend not just my lover
Share your thoughts with me
Love my mind not just my body, baby
CHORUS
Do you really want me, baby?  Let me know
Cuz if you really like me I suggest you tell me so
Got no time for silly games, that ain't even why I came
Cuz I may be the kind of guy you like
Please understand the way I feel
I must have trust or there's no deal
My emotion's ain't to be
Played with or given free
I appreciate greatly
The way you toleratered me
Sometimes I do act flaky
I wouldn't blame you if you hate me
You put up with my butt
When I wouldn't give it up
Yeah, I know that really sucks
But if you wait awhile, I'll make it up
CHORUS
Who me?  A tease?  Brother, please
You're just having bad memories
About some skeeze who did the squeeze
And had you on your hands and knees
Look, I am telling you straight out
That's not what I'm all about
I'd just be playing myself out
If I spent the night at your house
Now don't get me wrong
I didn't mean to turn you on
We haven't known each other long
But this is my life not just a song
CHORUS"

Why do you play with my heart
Why do you play with my mind?
Said we'd be forever
Said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me
And never say good-bye?

When I can't sleep at night without holding you tight
Girl, each time I try I just break down and cry
Pain in my head oh I'd rather be dead
Spinnin' around and around

Maybe you'll try
We should be happy together
Forever, you and I

I mean, her butt, it's just so big. Ugh, I can't believe it's just so round, it's like out there, I mean, ugh, gross. Look! She's just so black!""

I like big butts and I cannot lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face, you get sprung
Wanna pull up tough 'cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearin'
I'm hooked and I can't stop starin'
Oh, baby, I wanna get wit'cha
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But that butt you got makes (me so horny!)
Oh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin
You say you wanna get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me
'Cause you ain't that average groupie
I've seen 'em dancin'
To hell with romancin'
She's wet, wet
Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back
So, fellas! (Yeah!) Fellas! (Yeah!)
Has your girlfriend got the butt? (Hell yeah!)
Tell 'em to shake it! (Shake it!) Shake it! (Shake it!)
Shake that healthy butt!
Baby got back!

(L.A. face with a Oakland booty)
Baby got back!

I like 'em round, and big
And when I'm throwin' a gig
I just can't help myself, I'm actin' like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I wanna get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh
I ain't talkin' 'bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Lot's in trouble
Beggin' for a piece of that bubble
So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Knock-kneed bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sistas, I wanna get wit'cha
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna *moan*
'Til the break of dawn
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies! (Yeah!) Ladies! (Yeah)
If you wanna roll in my Mercedes (Yeah!)
Then turn around! Stick it out!
Even white boys got to shout
Baby got back!

Baby got back!

""Yeah, baby. When it comes to females, Cosmo ain't got nothin' to do with my selection. 36-24-36? Ha ha, only if she's 5'3"".""

So your girlfriend rolls a Honda
Playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you've got buns, hun
You can do side bends or sit-ups
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers wanna play that hard role
And tell you that the butt ain't gold
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that!
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' 'bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines:
You ain't it, Miss Thing!
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to diss
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round
And you want a triple X throwdown
Dial 1-900-MIX-A-LOT
And kick them nasty thoughts
Baby got back!

Baby got back!
Little in the middle but she got much back!"

Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you
Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

But now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

Sometimes the very thing
You're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see
Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last
You went and saved the best for last"

""Do you still love me?""
But after that
My whole world is beautiful

Yeah, right. Too late. Sure. Eat this

I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same
Now, I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight

But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

They print my message in the Saturday sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none
And I told 'em about equality
And it's true, either you're wrong or you're right

But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
So when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean

Protection for gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places, faces
Where your blood comes from is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye

But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white"

He never really liked me anyway
Or tell your Aunt Louise, tell anything you please
Myself already knows I'm not okay
Or you can tell my eyes to watch out for my mind
It might be walking out on me today

But don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man, ooh

Don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man

Don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man, ooh-ooh"

And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain

We've been through this such a long, long time
Just tryna kill the pain, ooh yeah
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today
Walkin' away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head, just knowin' that you were mine
All mine

So, if you want to love me
Then, darlin', don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain

Do you need some time on your own?
Do you need some time all alone?
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you, woah-woah


Sometimes, I need some time on my own
Sometimes, I need some time all alone
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?


An' when your fears subside
An' shadows still remain, ooh yeah
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame

So, never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain

The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights

And I keep seeing you walk through that door

Maybe I just want to have it all
It makes a sound like thunder, it makes me feel like rain
And like a fool who will never see the truth
I keep thinking something's gonna change

And there's no way home, when it's late at night and you're all alone
Are there things that you wanted to say?
And do you feel me beside you in your bed
There beside you, where I used to lay?

Yo, I bust him in the eye, and then I'll take the punk's ho
Feelin', funkin', amps in the trunk and I got more rhymes
Than there's cops at a Dunkin' Donuts shop
Sho' nuff, I got props
From the kids on the Hill plus my mom and my pops
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!

Jump around! (Jump around!)
Jump around! (Jump around!)
Jump around! (Jump around!)
Jump up, jump up and get down!
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! (Everybody jump)
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! (Everybody jump)
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
Jump!

I'll serve your ass like John McEnroe
If your girl steps up, I'm smacking the ho
Word to your moms, I came to drop bombs
I got more rhymes than the Bible's got Psalms
And just like the Prodigal Son I've returned
Anyone stepping to me, you'll get burned
'Cause I got lyrics, but you ain't got none
If you come to battle, bring your shotgun (Shotgun)
But if you do you're a fool, 'cause I duel to the death
Trying to step to me, you'll take your last breath
I got the skills, come get your fill
'Cause when I shoot the gift, I shoot to kill
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!

Jump around! (Jump around!)
Jump around! (Jump around!)
Jump around! (Jump around!)
Jump up, jump up and get down!
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! (Everybody jump)
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! (Everybody jump)
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
Jump!

I'm the cream of the crop, I rise to the top
I never eat a pig 'cause a pig is a cop
Or better yet a Terminator, like Arnold Schwarzenegger
Try to play me out like as if my name was Sega
But I ain't going out like no punk bitch
Get used to one style and yo and I might switch
It up, up and around, then buck, buck you down
Put out your head and then you wake up in the Dawn of the Dead
I'm coming to get ya, I'm coming to get ya
Spitting out lyrics, homie, I'll wet ya
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!

Jump around! (Jump around!)
Jump around! (Jump around!)
Jump around! (Jump around!)
Jump up, jump up and get down!
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! (Everybody jump)
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

You've got to live and learn
Before your bridges burn
You've got to live and learn
Here's a little story about life
Everybody that lives surely dies
A lot of people ask the questions why
Some people have to go through so much more
Before they really learn about life's score
The subject is not to be ignored (Kick it to 'em, Joe)

I don't wanna be the one
To tell you how it's gotta be
Livin' is the only way
You're ever really gonna see

Ah, yeah
Y'all, check it
Kick this one for the Public
Now break it down
There's so much wrong and negativity
Enough for the whole world to see
I know there's still a possibility
You raise a little kid, he turns out bold
It may be from the way you treat him cold
I guess that's how the story's told (Tell 'em what it is)



You've got to live and learn
(I don't wanna be the one)
You've got to live and learn
(To tell you how it's gotta be)
Before your bridges burn
(Livin' is the only way)
You've got to live and learn
(That you're ever gonna see)
(Large) If large is how ya livin'
Why you're livin' large, are you takin' what is given
To you, in the form of true experience
'Cause if you're not your whole life could be spent
Doin' time for a crime you say you didn't even do
The only fool that you're foolin' is the fool that is you
Didn't even turn around to check and see if your bridge is burnin'
I guess it's true what they say that without livin' there's no learnin'
And this is from the J, the O, and the E
Mary, Mary, Mary, it's quite contrary
Yo', how did you earn your dough
You didn't finish school, you ain't got no job
But to the human eye it's pretty simple
You're always talkin' about what you want is respect
But never thinkin' about the little boy you neglect
Spendin' his formative years in a livin' hell
Not realizin' one day he'd end up in jail
Now on the other hand
There's Dan my man
Who planned a scam and I'll be damned
It was the ultimate flim flam
He was sayin' that it was easy as pie
But little did Dan know he was about to die"

When you love someone
And you want to love them right
Got to get more lovin' about you
And you know that you're holding on too tight
Soon they will be leaving without you
Say that you love someone
Why are you calling all my friends
Thinking I've got something to hide
Girl you don't love no one
You don't know what love's about
You lose the game, (if you) if you play that way

Girl when you trust someone
You don't call on everybody
Ain't nobody foolin' around
And the more I think about it
You lose all your clout
You lose the game, baby, if you play that way

My name is Brown
That's what I'm called
So don't try to step to be wrong
Or you'll fall slow
'Cos I just wanna get something to you
Maybe take control of you just like
I told you (I wanna roll)
On a tip that's movin
Im gonna make ya movin, grovin
Leavin ya like Ooo
When I touch ya
Give ya so much
The feeling of the effect that I'm dealin
When I rub ya up & down

Girl you said you love me
And you said you trust me
Why do you think I'm foolin' around
I can't stand the pressure
You know I'm yours forever
Ain't nobody, nobody, nobody humpin' around

I'll do such things to ease your pain
Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed

Damn I wish I was your lover

If I was your girl believe me
I'd turn on the Rolling Stones
We could groove along and feel much better
Let me in
I could do it forever and ever and ever and ever
Give me an hour to kiss you
Walk through heaven's door I'm sure
We don't need no doctor to feel much better
Let me in
Forever and ever and ever and ever

I sat on the mountainside with peace of mind
I lay by the ocean making love to her with visions clear
Walked for days with no one near
And I return as chained and bound to you

Damn I wish I was your lover

Make sure you are smiling and warm

To what we had?
The good times that made us laugh
Outweigh the bad
I thought we'd get to see forever
But forever's gone away
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday
I don't know where this road
Is going to lead
All I know is where we've been
And what we've been through
If we get to see tomorrow
I hope it's worth all the wait
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday
And I'll take with me the memories
To be my sunshine after the rain
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday
And I'll take with me the memories

Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Anyway the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!

Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me

Down and out, losing ground
Although I am Black and proud
Problems got me pessimistic
Brothers and sisters keep messin up
Why does it have to be so damn tough
I don't know where I can go
To let these ghosts out of my skull
My grandma's passed, my brother's gone
I never at once felt so alone
I know you're supposed to be my steering wheel
Not just my spare tire (home)
But Lord I ask you (home)
To be my guiding force and truth (home)
For some strange reason it had to be (home)
He guided me to Tennessee (home)

Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

Lord it's obvious we got a relationship
Talking to each other every night and day
Although you're superior over me
We talk to each other in a friendship way
Then outta nowhere you tell me to break
Outta the country and into more country
Past Dyersburg into Ripley
Where the ghost of childhood haunts me
Walk the roads my forefathers walked
Climbed the trees my forefathers hung from
Ask those trees for all their wisdom
They tell me my ears are so young (home)
Go back to from whence you came (home)
My family tree my family name (home)
For some strange reason it had to be (home)
He guided me to Tennessee (home)

Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

Eshe, she went down to Holly Springs
Rasadon and Baba, they went down to Peachtree
Headliner, I challenge you to a game of horseshoes, a game of horseshoes

Now I see the importance of history
Why my people be in the mess that they be
Many journeys to freedom made in vain
By brothers on the corner playing ghetto games
I ask you Lord why you enlightened me
Without the enlightment of all my folks
He said cause I set myself on a quest for truth
And he was there to quench my thirst
But I am still thirsty
The Lord allowed me to drink some more
He said what I am searching for are
The answers to all which are in front of me
The ultimate truth started to get blurry
For some strange reason it had to be
It was all a dream about Tennessee

Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

Headliner, I won the game of horseshoes
Now you owe me a watermelon
Let's go climb trees and skip over rocks
Do like they do below the border
Speech's hair
Don't it look like the roots of the tree that the ancestors were hung from
But that's okay, get it cause he's down to Earth"

I was abandoned and alone
Without a penny to my name
So very young and so afraid
No proper shoes upon my feet
Sometimes I couldn't even eat
I often cried myself to sleep

But still I had to keep on going
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way

If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
You're gonna make it happen, oh, yeah

I know life can be so tough
And you feel like giving up
But you must be strong, baby, just hold on
You'll never find the answers
If you throw your life away
I used to feel the way you do

Still I had to keep on going
Never knowing if I could take it

I struggled and I prayed

Runnin' fast along the sand
A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flyin' from your hands

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Baby, you're the one

There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels
When chances breathe between the silence
Where sex and love no longer gel, oh
For each man, in his time, is Cain
Until he walks along the beach
And sees his future in the water
A long, lost heart within his reach

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed

Set adrift on memory bliss of you

The camera pans the cocktail glass
Behind a blind of plastic plants
I found the lady with the fat diamond ring
Then you know I can't remember a damn thing
I think it's one of those d√©j√† vu things
Or a dream that's tryin' to tell me somethin'
Or will I ever stop thinkin' about it
I don't know, I doubt it
Subterranean by design
I wonder what I would find
If I met you, let my eyes caress you
Until I meet the thought of Mrs Princess Who?
I often wonder what makes her work
I guess I'll leave that question to the experts
Assuming that there are some out there
They're probably alone, solitaire
I can remember when
I caught up with a past-time intimate friend
She said, bet you're probably gonna say I look lovely
But you probably don't think nothin' of me
She was right, though, I can't lie
She's just one of those corners in my mind
And I just put her right back with the rest
That's the way it goes, I guess

Baby you send me, baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

A careless whisper from a careless man
A neutron dance for a neutron fan
Marionette strings are dangerous things
I thought of all the trouble they bring
An eye for an eye, a spy for spy
Rubber bands expand in a frustrating sigh
Tell me that she's not dreaming
She's got an ace in the hole, it doesn't have meaning
Reality used to be a friend of mine
Cause complete control, I don't take too kind
Christina Applegate, you gotta put me on
And guess whose piece of the cake is Jack gone?
She broke her wishbone and wished for a sign
I told her whispers in my heart were fine
What did she think she could do?
I feel for her, I really do
And I stared at the ring finger on her hand
I wanted her to be a big PM Dawn fan
But I had to put her right back with the rest
That's the way it goes, I guess

Baby you send me, baby you send me

We used to walk along the river
And dream our way out of this town

No one cared until the night she went out walking all alone
And never came home
Man with a badge came knocking next morning
Here was I surrounded by a thousand fingers suddenly
Pointed right at me

The Mac (The Mac)
Known for breaking 'em off something
They laying in the back and front keeping your speakers pumping
The miggida-miggida-miggida Mac came to get 'em warm
And my pants to the back, that's my everyday uniform
You little cream puff Mac Daddy wannabe
Keep dreaming 'cause a Mac you will never be
So all y'all with the Dr. Seuss riddles
You can get the finger - the middle

Ay, yo Kris, kick it

I caught you on the scope (the scope)
Peepin' out my rhymes that's this dope (it's dope)
And for you there's no hope
My name (is what?) Daddy Mac, baby
Totally Krossed Out catching all the ladies
At the age I be, I should be playing with toys
Instead I put my head into making you make noise
That's how I kick it, that's my everyday life and
I rehearse to keep it sharp as a knife, man
I'm the wrong brother for suckers to be messing with
'Cause when I put the mic in my hand I start wrecking it
They call me the D-A-double-D-Y-M-A-C
And there ain't another brother bad as me
When I (let go) something from the (ghetto), word
A little brother kicking rhymes like you never ever heard
Daddy of them all, shooting the gift like a gun
Showing suckers how it's done

Yeah, now you all know (what's up?)
And the Macs are all that (yeah)

Business as I kick up the treble tone
On my radio tape player box, right
Just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype, see?
Outta nowhere comes the woman I'm dating
Investigation maybe she was demonstrating
But nevertheless I was pleased
My day was going great and my soul was at ease
Until a group of brothers started bugging out
Drinking the 40 oz, going the nigga route
Disrespecting my black queen
Holding their crotches and being obscene
At first I ignored them cause see I know their type
They got drunk and got guns and they wanna fight
And they see a young couple having a time that's good
And their egos wanna test a brother's manhood
So they came to test Speech cause of my hair-do
And the loud bright colors that I wear 
I was a target cause I'm a fashion misfit
And the outfit that I'm wearing brothers dissing it
Well I stay calm and pray the niggas leave me be
But they're squeezing parts of my date's anatomy
Why, Lord, do brothers have to drill me ?
Cause if I start to hit this man he'll have to kill me

I am everyday people (2x)

I told the niggas please let us pass, friend
I said please cause I don't like killing Africans
But he wouldn't stop and I ain't Ice Cube
But I had to take the brother out for being rude
And like I said before I was mad by then
It took three or four cops to pull me off of him
But that's the story y'all of a black man
Acting like a nigga and get stomped by an African

The moral of the story is you better look very hard at who you're stepping to, cause you might get killed or shot and it's not worth it. Africans need to be loving each other and unite"

Huh yeah let me introduce y'all to the wildside
Annie was a high school cheerleader
Pom poms and bobby socks and no girl was sweeter
Come prom time everybody was on the line
All the fellas singing nickel and dime
Tales about love and lust and trust
But Annie took it in all in stride
Cause deep inside annie had aspirations
Wanted to be a chemical engineer
Making 50 to 55 thousand a year
Her first year of college was a success
But along came Billy possessed and obsessed
He took Annie on a fatal date
And showed her things that made heart beats accelerate
Annie took a hit breathed two short breaths
One for life the last for death
Now she's gone a former valedictorian
Ended up becoming a topic for historians
Washed up dreams, shattered pride
All because Annie took a hit on the wildside
(Chorus)
Ron had enough of being broke every day
Saying to himself. There's gotta be a better way
Cause 9 to 5 wasn't worth the headaches
So ron figured out a faster way to make money
Before you know it, he's a rich man
Gold on every finger of his hand
A brand new BMW. A condo. Ron ended up a john doe
A body was found in the alley but never claimed
Full of bullet holes but none to blame
Ron became another victim of homicide
Because he chose to walk on the wildside
(Chorus)
Charles had everything going for him
A top paying job a good life. A good wife
A baby boy on the way any day
A gentleman attitude is all he displayed
Carol was the wife he loved and adored
Her family and friends treated him like an ambassador
One night on the other side of town
A police dispatcher picked up a weird sound
Charles on the car phone asking for help
Claiming a burglar shot his wife and himself
His pregnant wife lay slumped over
Dreams corrupt and a young life over
Extensive searches throughout the projects
Put a lot of people through misery and wreck
Everyone a suspect till someone was found
Interrogated cause their skin was brown
Then there was Benny, guilty until proven so
But soon as the case started moving slow
What do you know, sure as a sea gull gets webbed toed
Charles was the culprit
The whole plot was an insurance scam
Charles and his brother came up with a plan
Kill carol collect a big check
Blame it on a black man. What the heck!
And just before the story was known
Charles had a feeling his cover was blown
So he jumped off a bridge
Committed suicide
This is how it is on the wildside!
(Chorus)
Little Tiffany. Only thirteen
Came to the city. Place of big dreams
Visiting family and friends for the summer time
Sitting on a mailbox, watching the boys climb trees
And the girls play hopscotch
So far her vacation was top notch
But of the blue a Mercedes at top speed
Gang bangers chasing the robbers on the stampede
Quick as a blink shots rang out loud
And a hail of bullets zipped through the crowd
One hit Tiffany and instantly she died
Innocently on the wildside"
2770,70,Do I Have to Say the Words?,Bryan Adams,1992,do i have to say the words,bryan adams, NA ,1.0,1,"Rescue me from the mire
Whisper words of desire
Rescue me - darling rescue me
With your arms open wide
Want you here by my side
Come to me - darling rescue me
When this world's closing in
There's no need to pretend
Set me free - darling rescue me
I don't wanna let you go
So I'm standing in your way
I never needed anyone like I'm needing you today
Do I have to say the words?
Do I have to tell the truth?
Do I have to shout it out?
Do I have to say a prayer?
Must I prove to you how good we are together?
Do I have to say the words
Rescue me from despair
Tell me you will be there
Help me please- darlin rescue me
Every dream that we share

Eighty West, back to the hotel

At the telly, Vogues is doing pipe work
Johnny Z had his hand up a miniskirt
The latte in the corner started to flirt
And I knew that when she saw me baby doll was gonna jaw me
Set for the night so I took her to my ride
Grab my Mickey and my Buddha and I met her outside
Who-ride, rolling striking through to be seen
A Lexus 400 turnin' triple gold Zeens
Acid in my bottle, so I gotta get some more
Put the pedal to the metal back to the liquor store
'Cause you know what I mean when I'm feelin' kinda funky
A sick honky, straight goin' donkey
Money in my sock, jimmy in the glove
Layin in the Lexus, I'm about to make good love
And burn rubber up the block
Back to the telly, I gotta get some new cock
New cock (echoes)

Lock the load, let's go look for like 118

I can't tell who I should trust or just who I let trust me, yeah

I let a lot of people depend on me
I never thought they would ever deceive me
Don't you know when times got rough
I was standing on my own
I'll never let another get that close to me
You see, I've grown a lot smarter now
Sometimes you have to choose and then you'll see
If your friend is true, they'll be there with you
Through the thick and thin

What about your friends? (What about your friends?)
Will they stand their ground?
Will they let you down again? (Woah)
What about your friends? (What about your friends?)
Are they gonna be low down (Be low down)
Will they ever be around? (Be around)
Or will they turn their backs on you?
What about your friends? (What about your friends?)
Will they stand their ground? (Stand their ground)
Will they let you down again? (Oh)
What about your friends? (What about your friends?)
Are they gonna be low down (Be low down)
Will they ever be around? (Be around)
Or will they turn their backs on you?

Yo, is it me? Here we go
Or can it be I am a little too friendly?
So to speak hypothetically say?
I supply creativity to what others must take as a form of self-hate
Only to make an enemy, which results in unfortunate destiny
They dog me out then be next to me
Just cause I am what some choose to envy

What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground?
Will they let you down again?
What about your friends? (What about your friends?)
Are they gonna be low down?
Will they ever be around? (Be around)
Or will they turn their backs on you?
What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground?
Will they let you down again?
What about your friends? (What about your friends?)
Are they gonna be low down? (Be low down)
Will they ever be around? (Be around)
Or will they turn their backs on you?

People say I act a little funny
I wouldn't change not for no money
I'll be a friend as long as you're a friend to me
Yeah, yeah (What about your friends?)
Even though I might be easy
It don't give you no cause to deceive me
It's not the way that I want my friends to ever be

What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground?
Will they let you down again?
What about your friends? (What about your friends?)
Are they gonna be low down? (Be low down)
Will they ever be around? (Will they ever be around)
Or will they turn their backs on you? (Or will they turn their backs on you?)
What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground? (Stand their ground)
Will they let you down again?
What about your friends?"

Dark sides best unseen
And we wonder why we're feeling this way

Sometimes I wonder if we really feel the same
Why we can be unkind
Questioning the strongest of hearts
That's when we must start
Believing in the one thing that has gotten us this far

That's what love is for
To help us through it
That's what love is for
Nothing else can do it
Melt our defenses
Bring us back to our senses
Give us strength to try once more
Baby, that's what love is for

Sometimes I see you
And you don't know I am there
And I'm washed away
By emotions I hold deep down inside
Getting stronger with time
It's living through the fire
And holding on we find

That's what love is for
To help us through it
That's what love is for
Nothing else can do it
Melt our defenses

Talk us down from the ledges

Stop bugging me
""Get up and move your sleepy head""
Don't shake my tree
He said, ""Mow the lawn"", who me?
""Walk the dog"", not my style, man
""Take out the trash"", no way
""Tidy your room"", come on, get real
Sorry Dad, got to disappear
Let's get the rock out of here

Seven day weekend, up all night
In at the deep end, hang on tight
It won't take a minute, it won't take long
So get on in it, come on, come on, come on

Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's go all the way, get it night and day
Come on, let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked

I'm your average ordinary everyday dude
Driving with my baby to get her in the mood
She's dialing through my radio and I'm ready to make my move
What she got ain't rock 'n' roll and it really blew my groove
It was Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven
It makes me want to scream
Bach, Tchaikovsky, violins
Turn it off, that ain't my scene
Well, I'm sorry, girl, here's my confession
I suppose a rock's out of the question

Seven day weekend, up all night
In at the deep end, hang on tight
It won't take a minute, it won't take long
So get on in it, come on, come on, come on

Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's go all the way, get it night and day
Come on, let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked

Hey, all I want to do is take a ride into the blue
Every time I want to love you, I get stuck inside my room
Heaven knows I'm sick and tired of dancing with this broom
I feel lucky today
Hey, look at that, man
Do you want to get rocked?
Do you want to get rocked?
Ho, it won't take you a minute
It won't take that long
So get on, get with it
Oh, come on everybody

Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Get on top baby
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Do you wanna, do you wanna?
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Get on top of it
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Love to rock your body baby
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's go all the way, get it night and day
Let's get out and play, rock the night away
Come on, let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked

Do you want to get rocked?"

With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do

Ticklin you around Delware before I enter
Turn to seduction from face hips to feet
A wiggle and a jiggle can make the night complete

Hey, you, in the black boots
Knee, highs, with the Daisy Dukes
Lookin' real fly while in cahoots
In the park, where I can do you
I'm L.A. Sno, here to relate to you
How I started the trend of them Daisy Dukes
Ever since, the summer of the ‚Äô90s
Girls lookin' good, with their future behind, see
Many terms are used to express
We're talkin' 'bout the booty, not the breast
Baby got back, the junk in the trunk
She got a six pack or a hell of a rump
Yo
Please, some fries with that shake
See, many terms are used to relate
I love the girls with the big ol' booties
Where I'm from, they call 'em Dukies
Pretty brown cheeks, hangin' from the jeans
Even city girls kick the country things
So if you get it, got it good, just dip the dug out
Them damn Daisy Dukes are turnin' 'er out
Say

Come on, baby
Kick them Daisies
Repeat Chorus

""YEAH, just hit me""

Say, look at them girls with the Daisy Dukes on
They really got it goin' on
Yeah, they be kickin' it sweet
With them long ol' boots on feet
And check out the way they step
Make your brother wanna think about sex
Especially when they have nice legs
If they're tan, drive off red
It don't mean what kind of legs you like
Still be kickin' those legs in lily white
So it won't make one difference on you
As long as you're kickin' them Daisy Dukes

Come on, baby
Kick them Daisies
Repeat Chorus

""YEAH, just hit me""
""Hold it now""

A thrilling chase (A wondrous place)

With lust in my eyes, sure don't give a damn
And ya don't know that I've been dreamin'
Of ya in my fantasy
Never once you looked at me
Don't even realize that I'm wantin' you to fulfill my needs?
Think what you want, let your mind free
Run free to a place no one dares to

How many nights I've laid in bed
Excited over you?
I've closed my eyes and thought of us
A hundred different ways
I've gotten there so many times
I wonder how 'bout you
Day and night, night and day
All I've got to say is

If I was your girl, oh, the things I'd do to you
I'd make you call out my name, I'd ask who it belongs to
If I was your woman, the things I'd do to you
But I'm not, so I can't, then I won't, but if I was your girl

Allow me some time to play with your mind
And you'll get there again and again
Close your eyes and imagine my body undressed
Take your time cause we've got all night, ooh
You on the rise as you're touchin' my thighs
And let me know what you like, if you like I'll go
Down, down, down, down, da, down, down
I'll hold you in my hand and maybe

Your smooth and shiny feels so good
Against my lips, sugar
I want you so bad
I can taste your love right now, baby
Day and night, night and day
All I've got to say is

If I was your girl, oh, the things I'd do to you
I'd make you call out my name, I'd ask who it belongs to
If I was your woman, the things I'd do to you
But I'm not, so I can't, then I won't, but if I was your girl
If I was your girl, oh, the things I'd do to you
I'd make you call out my name, I'd ask who it belongs to
If I was your woman, the things I'd do to you
But I'm not, so I can't, then I won't, but if I was your girl

I've laid in bed excited over you
One hundred different ways
I've thought of many, many
All I want to say is

If I was your girl, oh, the things I'd do to you
I'd make you call out my name, I'd ask who it belongs to
If I was your woman, the things I'd do to you

Love breaks your heart
Love takes no less than everything
Love makes it hard
And fades away so easily

In this world we've created
In this place that we live
In a blink of an eye, baby, the darkness slips in
Love lights the world
Unites the lovers for eternity

Love breaks the chain
Love aches for every one of us
Love takes the tears and the pain
And turns it into the beauty that remains

Look at this place
It was paradise, but now it's dying
I'll pray for love
I'll take my chances that it's not too late

Like a firefly without a light
You were there like a blowtorch burning
I was a key that could use a little turning
So tired that I couldn't even sleep
So many secrets I couldn't keep
Promised myself I wouldn't weep
One more promise I couldn't keep

It seems no one can help me now
I'm in too deep
There's no way out
This time I have really led myself astray

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Can you help me remember how to smile?
Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
How on earth did I get so jaded?
Life's mystery seems so faded
I can go where no one else can go
I know what no one else knows
Here I am, just drowning in the rain
With a ticket for a runaway train

And everything seems cut and dry
Day and night
Earth and sky
Somehow I just don't believe it

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there


Bought a ticket for a runaway train
Like a madman laughing at the rain
A little out of touch, a little insane
It's just easier than dealing with the pain

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Runaway train never coming back
Runaway train tearing up the track
Runaway train burning in my veins
Runaway but it always seems the same"

Another phat, phat track, so Rhythm D, pour the orange juice
And let's relax while sippin' on 'gnac because it's like that
I'm cautious of hoes, so Paperboy wears prophylactic
I wear a jimmy for the skinny that's in the long trench
Front row seats, so yo I know she's on the nine inch
Just to get a piece of the green, but she's an undertaker
Not knowin' the paper is a 'round the world heart-breaker
Many say I front, but yo, had to have a break down
Playin' you fools, so now you know why my belly's round
Takin' the rap back up and scoopin' up crowds just like a steel shovel
Not from the ghetto, but yo, take me to another level
Let the beat ride, but hold on to your woman, G
'Cause now that I'm rich so many women wanna do me
It make a man say 'damn'
I'm finally taxin' more than your homey Sam
But let me speak to the weak, I mean the rookies
My time is held up, extremely for cookies
Just let me clock this grip in ninety-two
And you don't bother me and I sure 'nuff won't bother you
And uh, you just watch a brother flowin' like Niagara
Think before you step, because these lyrics just might stag ya
Although I'm labeled with the black fade
It's gold D's on my four and gold 'lex, 'cause I got it made
I broke the veto once again because I had to
And just like Jody Watley, baby girl, I can have you
Just let me work this track, and yo, any way is OK
Your place or mine, all night until the next day, huh

Do the Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Now here we go from the top, second verse of the same song
With the conclusion, hoes should be happy for the ding-dong
And since a man clock a grip, G
It's like every nigga that I see be like, 'Do you remember me?'
A hustler, and it's known with more hoes than Lego
Keep 'em chunky like Prego, so niggas leggo my Eggo
I have a tendency to flow, start off with my own groove
And pick up the mic, and all of a sudden, I see high movin'
Guess it's like magic, and Paperboy is the magician
If I was a vacuum I'd be suckin' up competition
Let it ride again, and yo, believe I got my own thing
Straight Bahama hoes so miss me with a chick from Soul Train
And I'm a break my note, just to show up tokin'
So hide his eyes when I scoop him, 'cause we bud smokin'
A black man tryin' to make it and that ain't no fair
But just like BeBe and CeCe, I'll take you there, huh

Do the Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Now here we go, uh, let's take a trip to another land
Clock a grip, come back and watch the hoes tan
Jump in the Lex-o, and roll out to my cabin
Believe me my brother, more hoes than you can imagine
All on the ding-a-ling, just because the gold rings
But I'm like 'What's up with ya? You ain't heard a damn thing'
Make sure you got the jim hats, strapped for protection
Because to me, my life is more than my erection
And give me a hand, if you a fan, it ain't over yet
'Cause doin' the Ditty with Paperboy makes the ocean sweat
Kick the kind of style that knock the funk off of Fritos
Make you man jealous while hoes cheese like Doritos
It ain't my fault, I lay the pipe with concern-and
I ain't from Mount Vernon, but a brother's money-earnin'
And don't disagree and then jock, that's a pity
Just bob your head for Paperboy and the Ditty
Yeah

Do the Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
To do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
To do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty if you want to

I go walking in my sleep
From the mountains of faith
To a river so deep
I must be looking for something
Something sacred I lost
But the river is wide
And it's too hard to cross
And even though I know the river is wide
I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore
And try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find out what I've been looking for
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the valley of fear
To a river so deep
And I've been searching for something
Taken out of my soul
Something I would never lose
Something somebody stole
I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is that I've been looking for
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the jungle of doubt
To a river so deep
I know I'm searching for something
Something so undefined
That it can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind
In the middle of the night
I'm not sure about a life after this
God knows I've never been a spiritual man
Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river
That runs to the promised land
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the desert of truth
To the river so deep
We all end in the ocean
We all start in the streams
We're all carried along
By the river of dreams
In the middle of the night

Lately, there's seem to be
Some insecurities
About the way I feel
Where I wanna be
But you know, it's with you
No one can do
The things you do
To me
Never to be mistaking
Long as it's love we're making
There'll be no hesitating
You and me
It always will be
And I won't leave
Your side
Cause you know (Love will be)

Right here
Be right here
Right here
Be right here
Don't you have
No fear (No fear)
Have no fear
No tears (No tears)
Love is here

True love, some don't believe in
That's what just I'm givin'
I'm gonna keep it strong
I'll be holding on
To you
No one can do
Me like you do
It's true
Sure as the sun is shining
Our love will keep on climbing
There's gonna be some rain
Gonna be some pain
But as long as I know
Boy, time will show
Our love will grow
And I know (Love will be)

Right here
Be right here (Be right here)
Right here
Be right here (you don't need to have)
No fear (No fear)
Have no fear
No tears
Love will be
Right here
Be right here
Right here
Be right here (you don't need to have no)
No fear (no fear)
Have no fear
No tears
Love is here

Won't let go
You should know
This thing is real
No questions
Just listen to your heart and
Love will be right

Baby, what's the problem, it seems like we're having trouble
You don't seem to understand
The life I lead ain't double
My heart belongs to you, and only you
And you know it's true
A phony imitation just won't do
Relax your mind, I'm not the kind who runs around and wastes no time
On the fine brothers that just don't compare
I'll be there, I swear, far and near, have no fear
I don't care
You can count on me, I'm right here

Right here
Be right here (Right here)
Right here
Be right here (you don't need to have no)
No fear (No fear)
Have no fear
No tears (No tears)
Love is here
Right here
Be right here
Right here
Be right here
No fear
Have no fear
No tears
Love will be

Love's gonna be
Love's gonna be
Love's gonna be
Love's gonna be (Right here)
Love's gonna be
Love's gonna be
Be right here
No fear
Love's gonna be
Love's gonna be
Love's gonna be
Love's gonna be (No tears)
Love is here
Love's gonna be
Love's gonna be
Love's gonna be
Love's gonna be
Love's gonna be
Love's gonna be"

Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you, you, you, you

You see through, right to the heart of me

I never knew love like I've known it with you
Will a memory survive, one I can hold on to

I don't really need to look very much further
I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow

In fact, no brotherman - here, have two
Two dollars means a snack for me
But it means a big deal to you
Be strong, serve God only
Know that if you do, beautiful heaven awaits
That's the poem I wrote for the first time
I saw a man with no clothes, no money, no plate
Mr. Wendal, that's his name
No one ever knew his name cause he's a no-one
Never thought twice about spending on a ol' bum
Until I had the chance to really get to know one
Now that I know him, to give him money isn't charity
He gives me some knowledge, I buy him some shoes
And to think blacks spend all that money on big colleges
Still most of y'all come out confused
Go ahead, Mr. Wendal
Go ahead, Mr. Wendal
Mr. Wendal has freedom
A free that you and I think is dumb
Free to be without the worries of a quick to diss society
For Mr. Wendal's a bum
His only worries are sickness
And an occasional harassment by the police and their chase
Uncivilized we call him
But I just saw him eat off the food we waste
Civilization, are we really civilized, yes or no
Who are we to judge
When thousands of innocent men could be brutally enslaved
And killed over a racist grudge
Mr. Wendal has tried to warn us about our ways
But we don't hear him talk
Is it his fault when we've gone too far
And we got too far, cause on him we walk
Mr. Wendal, a man, a human in flesh
But not by law
I feed you dignity to stand with pride
Realize that all in all you stand tall
Mr. Wendal
Lord, Mr. Wendal"

On the avenue
Thought I heard you talking softly
I turned on the lights, the TV
And the radio
Still I can't escape the ghost of you
What has happened to it all?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is the life that I recognize?
Gone away
But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive
Passion or coincidence
Once prompted you to say
""Pride will tear us both apart""
Well now pride's gone out the window
Cross the rooftops
Run away
Left me in the vacuum of my heart
What is happening to me?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is my friend when I need you most?
Gone away
But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive
Papers in the roadside
Tell of suffering and greed
Fear today, forgot tomorrow
Ooh, here beside the news
Of holy war and holy need
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk
(Just blown away)
And I don't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive
Every World
Is my World
(I will learn to survive)
Any World
Is my World
(I will learn to survive)
Any World
Is my World
Every World
Is my World..."

I want you to wear it and wear it good

Talking 'bout them times when I was by myself
I would always be looking for somebody else
But, as time went on, I had a talk with my mind
Friends like you and you I gotta leave behind

And so, you call me your friend
But you only want my ends
And I'll never see you if I had no loot (I'll never see them)
I'm just glad I know the truth
And I'm paying my own bills
And I'll never ever depend on you

Friends and enemies around me every day
I can't believe half the things they say
Taking me for granted giving no credit at all
I'll just keep bouncing like a bouncing ball
Everybody seems to disappear on me
Can't trust no one as far, as I can see
If I could be that fly that's on the wall
Listening to my friends talk about it all

You call me your friend
But you only want my ends
And I'll never see you if I had no loot (I'll never see them)
I'm just glad I know the truth
And I'm paying my own bills
And I'll never ever depend on you
Sons of Soul, y'all

I don't mean to step on nobody's foot, but ah -

When I need somebody there's nobody to call
When they need me, my phone rings off the wall
But these are my friends, and that's what they say
Constantly taking from me every day
You say...

You call me your friend
But you only want my ends
And I'll never see you if I had no loot (I'll never see them)
I'm just glad I know the truth
And I'm paying my own bills

And some days it don't come easy
And some days it don't come hard

And some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothing I've ever
Seen before, or will again

And maybe I'm crazy
Oh it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me
No one else can save me now but you
As long as the planets are turning
As long as the stars are burning
As long as your dreams are coming true-
You better believe it!

That I would do anything for love!
And I'll be there till the final act
And I would do anything for love!
And I'll take the vow and seal a pact
But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way
Tonight
And I would do anything for love!
Oh I would do anything for love!
Oh I would do anything for love!
But I won't do that!
No I won't do that!

And some days I pray for Soul
Some days I just pray to the God
Of Sex and Drums and Rock 'N' Roll
And some nights I lose the feeling
And some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all
When I watch you dance and the thunder rolls

And maybe I'm lonely
That's all I'm qualified to be
There's just one and only
One and only promise I can keep
As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true
You better believe it!

That I would do anything for love!
And you know it's true and thats a fact
I would do anything for love!
And there'll never be no turning back
But I'll never do it better than I do it with you
So long
So long

But I'll never stop dreaming of you every night of my life
No way
And I would do anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No I won't do that

Will you raise me up?
Will you help me down?
Will you help get me right out of this Godforsaken town?
Will you make it all a little less cold?

I can do that!
I can do that!

Will you hold me sacred
Will you hold me tight
Will you colorize my life
I'm so sick of black and white!
Can you make it all a little less old

I can do that!
Oh, Oh, I can do that!

Will you make me some magic with your own two hands?
Can you build an emerald city with these grains of sand?
Can you give me something I can take home?

I can do that
I can do that

Will you cater to every fantasy I've got?
Will you hose me down with holy water - If I get too hot?
Will you take me to places I'll never know?

I can do that!
Oh no, no, I can do that!

After a while you'll forget everything
Just a brief interlude, and a mid-summer night's fling
Then you'll see that it's time to move on

I won't do that
I won't do that

So stop trying to be loud as me cause you can't do that
Think about it; playing Russian roulette with an automatic

Stab and step and repping and run, packing a weapon is wild
Peace to the brothers on Rikers Isle

I try to think about you
I have a love for you that nothing hides
Whatever it is I do
I'm only thinking of you
I hope you look at me through patient eyes

I've become amused
I've become blind
I've become what I know not breathes
You seem illiterate to all my emotions
I stand corrected, how well you read
You speak the truth, you speak to me
You feel the love I have yet to find
I know it's there, I know it's there
But I let the sandcastles kill my mind
Pathetic me, I long to be you
I think I'm close but I stand so far
The turbulent one sheds a turbulent tear
I miss the love only cause they starve
Oil and water, lust and sympathy
I life and death my way through the sun
Where originates all the pain that leaves
My memory a traumatic sponge and sings to you

Well define my love with attitude
Open up your mind and it will sing to you
You can always tell
But I know remorse so well
I left reality early due to the lack of love, reason

Whatever it is I do
I try to think about you
I have a love for you that nothing hides
Whatever it is I do
I'm only thinking of you
I hope you look at me through patient eyes

The channel, a professional liar
How I long to contradict those vibes
Joni help me, I think I'm falling
It's not the love and I quest the why
I don't know, If I'm right, I'm right
But if I'm wrong then show me I'm wrong
The fear of pity is always awake
But infinite sympathy's completely gone
It's the windows, the doors
The passageways to the truth
Oh my God, it echoes the mind
In total recall as wild as the deuce
And so deceiving is the clouded heart
So superficial is the open wound
I caress the infinite light
That even at night overshadows the moon that sings to you

Well, define my love, that lives within you
Even when I die, it will sing to you
You can only tell if remorse has done you well
The misconstrued my answers due to the lack of love, reason

Whatever it is I do
I try to think about you
I seek the sympathy and I can't lie
Whatever it is I do
I'm only thinkin' of you
I hope you look at me through patient eyes
Whatever it is I do
I try to think about you
I seek the sympathy and I can't lie
Whatever it is I do
I'm only thinkin' of you
I hope you look at me through patient eyes
Whatever it is I do
I try to think about you
I seek the sympathy and I can't lie
Whatever it is I do
I'm only thinkin' of you
I hope you look at me through patient eyes"

Give it up for Naughty By Nature!
Hip Hop Hooray
Ho, hey, ho, hey, ho, hey, ho

You drew a picture of my mornin'
But you couldn't make my day (Hey!)
I'm rockin' and you're yawnin'
But you never look my way (Hey!)
I'm lickin' down your darlin'
In every single way (Hey!)
Your funny flow is foreign
And a green card's on the way

This ain't got shit to do with shampoo
But watch your head and shoulder
Brother older, bold enough to fold ya, yo I told ya
A raid afraid of what I made and played it, plus a funky fit
So save yo' flips and tricks for that music and the monkey bit

Triggers from the Grilltown Illtown
Some ask how it feels now
The deal is that we're real, so we're still 'round
Don't lamp with a freestyle phantom
Ain't tryin' to be handsome
Shrinkin' what you're thinkin', 'cause I'm vampin'

I live and die for Hip Hop, this is Hip Hop for today
I give props to hip-hop, so Hip Hop hooray

Ho, hey,¬†ho
Hey,¬†ho,¬†hey,¬†ho
Hip Hop Hooray
Ho, hey, ho
Hey, ho, hey, ho

You heard a lot about a brother gainin' mo' ground
Bein' low down, I do the showdown with any little ho round
No! I wanna know who you believe in
Through your funny reasons
Even when I'm sleepin' you think I'm cheatin'
You said: ""I know you, Mr. O.P.P. man
Yo, PP man, won't only see me man""
You should've known when I ain't hit it and step
That I was wit' it a bit, not to consider the rep, heck!
I did your partner 'cause she's hot as a baker
'Cause I'm Naughty by Nature, not 'cause I hate ya
You put your heart in a part of a part that spreads apart
And forgot that I forgave when you had a spark
You try to act like somethin' really big is missin'
Even though my name's graffiti-written on your kitten
I love black women always and disrespect ain't the way
Let's start a family today; Hip Hop Hooray

Ho, hey,¬†ho
Hey,¬†ho,¬†hey,¬†ho
Hip Hop Hooray
Ho, hey, ho
Hey, ho, hey, ho

Hip Hop, Hip Hip Hop, Hip Hip Hop, Hooray!
There's many hungry hip-hoppers
One reason Hip Hop's tip-top today
Swerve what you heard 'cause I ain't bailin' no hay
Ain't choppin' no crops, but still growin' every day

Here's a thunder sound from the wonders found
From the underground town down the hill
Feel how Illtown drown smiles to frowns
Snatchin' crowns from clowns, beatdowns are found
Don't know me? Don't come around!

Tippy tippy (pause) tippy tippy (pause)
Sometimes creepin' up I eat em up
Your styles are older than Lou Rawls
Peace to this one and that one and them
That way I shout-out and I didn't miss one friend
Fools get foolish, neither them or Parker Lewis knew us
You could have crews with shoes and can't step to us
Some kitties purr, now call me sir too
Lookin' for her crew; any trick that diss gets a curfew
I put on projects for boots
Step through troops and leave proof
My problem solver's name is Mook
I hittin' woodies in a hoodie
Peace to Josette, Jobete, Jo-Jo, Genae, and every hood G
That's right, my fight is ill
Peace goes to L.O.N.S. and Quest
Nice & Smooth and Cypress Hill
I live and die for Hip Hop, this is Hip Hop of today
I give props to Hip Hop, so Hip Hop Hooray

Ho, hey,¬†ho
Hey,¬†ho,¬†hey,¬†ho
Hip Hop Hooray
Ho, hey, ho

Since you been gone

With my mind messed up
Jumped in my car
Tried to clear my mind, didn't help me
I guess I'm all messed up now, baby
Soon as I jumped into my ride
Those memories start to play
A song comes on, on the radio
And there you are, baby
Once again

It's just another sad love song
Racking my brain like crazy
Guess I'm all torn up
Be it fast or slow
It doesn't let go
Or shake me
And it's all because of you

Since you been gone
I keep thinking about you, baby
Gets me all choked up
This heart of mine keeps dreaming of you
And it's crazy
You'd think I'd had enough, yeah
Soon as I get you out my head
I'm in my car again, ooh, darling
Just one request from the radio
I'm back in love, sugar
Once again

Just another sad love song

Here come the strings
Then somebody sings
Only takes a beat
And then it starts killing me, darling
Only takes one note I tell ya
From that radio
It's just another lonely love song

It's just another sad love song

Like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You are my friend
Carry me
Like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?

Weary
Tell me will you hold me
When wrong, will you scold me
When lost will you find me?
But they told me
A man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight till the end
But I'm only human

Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's
Got a role for me
I'm so confused
Will you show to me
You'll be there for me
And care enough to bear me
[Verse 4: Michael Jackson & Cleveland Orchestra
(Hold me)
(Lay your head lowly)
(Softly then boldly)
(Carry me there)
(Lead me)
(Love me and feed me)
(Kiss me and free me)
(I will feel blessed)

In our darkest hour, in my deepest despair
Will you still care?
Will you be there?
In my trials and my tribulations
Through our doubts and frustrations
In my violence, in my turbulence
Through my fear and my confessions
In my anguish and my pain
Through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow
I'll never let you part
For you're always in my heart"

Beware of what is flashing in her eyes
She's going to get you

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeah
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby (Is one more baby, yeah)
Ahhh, ahh

All that she wants is another baby (Is one more baby)
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby (Is one more baby)
All that she wants is another baby (Is one more baby)
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby (Is one more baby)

All that she wants
All that she wants"

And I saw an angel come down unto me
In her hand she holds the very key
Words of compassion, words of peace
And in the distance an army's marching feet
1 2 3 4, 1 2 3 4
But behold, we will watch them fall
And we lay down on the sand of the sea
And before us animosity will stand and decree
That we speak not of love only blasphemy
And in the distance, six others will curse me
But that's all right
That's all right
For I will watch them fall

All seven and we'll watch them fall

I am yours now and you are mine
And together we'll love through
All space and time, so don't cry
One day all seven will die
Just how old

And we will see a plague and a river of blood
And every evil soul will surely die in spite of
Their seven tears, but do not fear
For in the distance, twelve souls from now
You and me will still be here - we will still be here
There will be a new city with streets of gold
The young so educated they never grow old
And a, there will be no death for with every breath
The voice of many colors sings a song
That's so bold
Sing it while we watch them fall

All seven and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love
And we will smoke them all
With an intellect and a savoir faire
No one in the whole universe
Will ever compare
I am yours now and you are mine
And together we'll love through
All space and time, so don't cry
One day all seven will die

Just how old
Just how old

The Ghetto x8
Snoop Doggy Dogg:
Wake up, jumped out my bed
I'm in a two man cell with my homie Lil' 1/2 Dead
Murder was the case that they gave me
Dear God, I wonder can you save me?
I'm only eighteen, so I'm a young buck
It's a ride, if I don't scrap, I'm gettin' stuck
But that's the life of G, I guess
Ese's way deep, shanked two in the chest
Best run cause brothers is droppin' quicker
Ugn, too late, damn, down goes another nigga
Bouncin' off the walls, throwin' them dogs
Gettin' that rep as a young hog
It ain't nothin' like the street life
You better be strapped with your shank
Cause ain't no fist fight
So I guess I gots to handle mine
Since I did the crime, I gots to do my time
Chorus:
We run game in the ghetto
We gets high in the ghetto
We gets shot in the ghetto
You might get stuck in the ghetto
Lil' Ghetto Boy
Dr. Dre:
Now I'm holdin' the dub, sittin' on swoll
Twenty-seven years old, up for parole, stroll
I'm back up on my feet with my mind on the money
That I be makin' soon as I touch them streets
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump, but now they blast, right?
But it ain't no thang to me
Cause now I'm what they call a loced ass O.G
The little homies from the hood with grip
Are the ones I get with cause I'm down to set trip
Nigga, I'm bigger than you, so whatcha wanna do?
Didn't know he had a twenty-two
Straight sittin' behind his back
I grabbed his pockets and then I heard six caps
I fell to the ground with blood on my hands
I didn't understand
How a nigga so young could bust a cap
I used to be the same way back
I guess that's what I get (for what?)
For tryin' to jack the little homies for they grip
Chorus
Snoop Doggy Dogg:
Somethin' for the real O.G.'s to get with
Some facts made our made
Now you runnin' but I'm played
Like every single day, really doe
You know me, I'm the smooth macadamian
Gamin'em for my homie
No need in be uncalm, if you pack right
And learnin' just enough to keep your sack tight
Late nights, I wonder what they get in for?
Early mornin' on the corners, what they hittin' for?
Seven young G's put they serve down
In a G ride, Eastside's where they swerve now
Not thinkin' about what's really goin' on
Got crept on, stepped on, now they gone
I spent four years in the county
With nothin' but convicts around me
But now I'm back at the Pound
And we expose ways for the youth to survive
Some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's right
So make all them ends you can make
Cause when you're broke, you break, check it out
So ain't no need for your mama to trip
Cause you's a hustlin' ass youngsta, clockin' your grip
Chorus
Lil' Ghetto Boy
That's the life of a G, I guess
The ghetto. x3
That's the life of a G
That's the life of a G, I guess
The ghetto. x3
That's the life of a G. The ghetto
That's the life of a G, I guess

Standing close to someone else
Now I sit all alone

I gave my best to you

Nothing for me to do
But have one last cry
One last cry
Before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you out of my mind this time
Stop living a lie
I guess I'm down to my last cry

I was here, you were there
Guess we never could agree
While the sun shines on you
I need some love to rain on me
Still I sit all alone
Wishing all my feeling was gone
Gotta get over you

Nothing for me to do
But have one last cry
One last cry
Before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you out of my mind this time
Stop living a lie

I know I gotta be strong
'Cause round me life goes on and on and on and on

I'm gonna dry my eyes
Right after I end my one last cry

One last cry
Before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you out of my mind for the very last time
Been living a lie

I guess I'm down
I guess I'm down

To those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check

Just another hazard of a fly guy

And ain't no need in being greedy, if you wanna see me
Dial the beeper number, baby, when you need me

At this old piano
Trying hard to capture
The moment this morning I don't know
Cause a bottle of Vodka
Is still lodged in my head
And some blonde gave me nightmares
I think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies
They won't make of me when I'm dead
With an ironclad fist I wake up and
French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps
Its own beat in my head
While we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and the truth and
What you mean to me
And the truth is baby you're all that I need...

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses

Well I'm so far away
That each step that I take is on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night
Just to see through this payphone
Still I run out of time
Or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper
Baby blind love is true

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses

The hotel bar hangover whiskey's gone dry
The barkeeper's wig's crooked
And she's giving me the eye
I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died


Now as you close your eyes
Know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again
Tonight I won't be alone
But you know that don't
Mean I'm not lonely
I've got nothing to prove
For it's you that I'd die to defend

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses"

So I slowly came to see all of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspiration lead me towards a real love

Real love, I‚Äôm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I‚Äôm searching for a real love
I got to have a real love

Love so true, and oh baby, I thought that love was true
I thought that you were the answer to the question in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong, if I stay strong, maybe I‚Äôll find
A real love

So I‚Äôve tried my best and prayed to God he‚Äôll send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me towards a love my heart can feel
Now I know I can be faithful, I can be your all and all
Ill give you good lovin' through the summertime, winter, spring and fall

Real love, I‚Äôm searching for a real love (Real love, real love)
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I‚Äôm searching for a real love
Real love, I‚Äôm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I‚Äôm searching for a real love

See, I'm searching for a real love and I don't know where to go
(Real love, I‚Äôm searching for a real love)
Been around the world and high and low and still I never know
(Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I‚Äôm searching for a real love)
How it feels to have a real love cause it seems it's not around
Gotta end it in this way 'cause it seems he can't be found

Real love, I‚Äôm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I‚Äôm searching for a real love
Real love, I‚Äôm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I‚Äôm searching for a real love
Real love"

Well, I'm out to have a real good time
And now you wanna try to fade me
But friends of yours are friends of mine
So don't even try to play me
If you don't have nothing good to say
The words you will be withholding
These kinds of games a girl will play
Just like mother told me, so

Here we go
Going through the same thing
(Here we go again)
Here we go
Don't wanna play the same game
(No, not again, I don't wanna go through it)

Now this ain't the time to make a scene
Because I'm out with my homies
I know you know just what I mean
So don't just walk up on me
There's a time and there's a place
Where we can talk about it
'Cause I don't want to be disgraced
With all your screams and shouting, but

Here we go
Going through the same thing
(Here we go again)
Here we go
Don't wanna play the same game
(No, not again, I don't wanna go through it)

Climb the mountain
(What mountain?)
Swim the sea
(What sea?)
See what I mean?
(No)
I don't know but I don't want to get too deep
(Here we go again)
Ah, oh, ah, no (Here we go)
Ah, oh, ah, no (No, not again, baby)
Ah, oh, ah, no (Here we go)
Ah, oh
Here we go again

Here we go
Going through the same thing
(Here we go again)
Here we go
Don't wanna play the same game
(No, not again, I don't wanna go through it)

Now there's no need to explain
You know how I feel about you
So don't you take my words in vain
You know I can't live without you
I need some time to unwind
So try to be understanding
I hope that you would change your mind
Instead of being so demanding, 'cause

Here we go
Going through the same thing
(Here we go again)
Here we go
Don't wanna play the same game
(No, not again, I don't wanna go through it)
Yo, kick it
Ah (Here we go)
Ah, ah (Yo, Portrait, there she goes)

Girl, I gotta say
We're partners in crime

Came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
He was talkin' 'fore I knew it
And as he grew, he said
""I'm gonna be like you, Dad""
""You know, I'm gonna be like you""

And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
""When you comin' home?"", ""Son, I don't know when""
""We'll get together then""
""You know we'll have a good time then""

Well, my son turned ten just the other day
He said, ""Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let's play""
""Could you teach me to throw?"" I said, ""Not today""
""I got a lot to do."" He said, ""That's okay""
And he walked away
And he smiled and he said
""You know, I'm gonna be like him, yeah""
""You know I'm gonna be like him""

And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
""When you comin' home?"", ""Son, I don't know when""
""We'll get together then""
""You know we'll have a good time then""

Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man, I just had to say
""I'm proud of you, could you sit for a while?""
He shook his head, and he said with a smile
""What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys""
""See you later. Can I have them, please?""

And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
""When you comin' home?"", ""Son, I don't know when""
""We'll get together then""
""You know we'll have a good time then""

I've long since retired, my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
""I'd like to see you, if you don't mind""
He said, ""I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time""
""You see, my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu""
""But it's sure nice talkin' to you, Dad, it's been sure nice talkin' to you""
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me, my boy was just like me

And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
""When you comin' home?"", ""Son, I don't know when""
""We'll get together then""
""You know we'll have a good time then""

That's not the way it's supposed to be
Sometimes my vision is a little hazy
I can't tell who I should trust or just who I let trust me, yeah
People try to say I act a little funny
But that's just a figure of speech to me
They tell me I changed because I got money
But if you were there before, then you're still down with me, yeah

What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground?
Will they let you down again?

Are they gonna be low down?
Will they ever be around?
Or will they turn their backs on you?

Well, is it me, or can it be I'm a little too
Friendly so to speak hypothetically say?
I supply creativity to what others
Must take as a form of self-hate
Only to make an enemy
Which results in unfortunate destiny
They dog me out then be next to me
Just 'cause I am what some choose to envy

Every now and then, I get a little easy
I let a lot of people depend on me
I never thought they would ever deceive me
Don't you know when times got rough
I was standing on my own
I'll never let another get that close to me
You see, I've grown a lot smarter now
Sometimes you have to choose and then you'll see
If your friend is true, they'll be there with you
Through the thick and thin

These pigs wanna blow my house down
Head underground to the next town
They get mad when they come to raid my pad
And I'm out in the nine-deuce Cad'
Yes I'm the pirate, pilot
Of this ship if I get with the ultraviolet dream
Hide from the red light beam
Now do you believe in the unseen?
Look, but don't make you eyes strain

Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter

I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
That's what my mama told me
'Round and 'round and 'round you go
When you find love, you'll always know
I let my father mold me

Daddy couldn't be all wrong
Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there
And my mama made me learn this song
You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you
That's why

I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
The deeper I go

All is fair in love she said
Think with your heart, not with your head
That's what my mama told me
All the little things you do
Will end up coming back to you

Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

Someone said that romance was dead
And I believed it instead of remembering
What my mama told me
Let my father mold me
Then you tried to hold me
You remind me what they said
This feeling inside
I can't explain
But my love is alive
And I'm never gonna hide it again


Daddy couldn't be all wrong
Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there
And my mama made me learn this song

Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain

When your lips are burning mine
And you take the time to tell me how you feel
When you listen to my words
And I know you've heard, I know it's real
Rain is what the thunder brings
For the first time I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not

And you said goodbye could you see my tears
When I turned the other way
Did you hear me say
I'd wait for all the dark clouds bursting in a perfect sky
You promised me when you said goodbye
That you'd return when the storm was done
And now I'll wait for the light, I'll wait for the sun
Till I feel your

And I say, never go away


Waiting is the hardest thing
It's strange

I tell myself that if I believe in you
I feel like I've known you before

In the dream of you
And I want to understand you

With all my heart and all my soul
More and more and more

That by sheer force of will
When I'm with you

I will raise you from the ground
I feel like a magical child

And without a sound, you'll appear
Everything strange

And surrender to me, to love
Everything wild

Rain is what the thunder brings
For the first time I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top
Till I feel your

They help me calm down and I can get through it
So higher higher, get your hands to the ceiling
Let it go y'all don't fight the feeling
Mic in a strangle hold, sweat pouring
And like Jordan yo I'm scoring
Yeah that's right y'all and I am in the flow
So pump up the volume, along with the tempo

Is paved with good intentions
It's littered with broken dreams
That never quite came true
When all of my hopes were dying
Her love kept me trying
She does her best to hide
The pain that she's been through
(CHORUS)
When she cries at night
And she doesn't think that I can hear her
She tries to hide
All the fears she feels inside
So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
'Cause I die a little each time
When she cries
She's always been there for me
Whenever I've fallen
When nobody else believes
She'll be there by my side
I don't know how she takes it
Just once I'd like to make it
Then there'll be tears of joy
That fill her loving eyes
(CHORUS)
So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
'Cause I die a little each time
When she cries"

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Uh

Just wakin' up in the morning, gotta thank God
I don't know, but today seems kinda odd
No barking from the dog, no smog
And Momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinkin', ""Will I live another twenty-four?""
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror and not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
""Which park are y'all playin' basketball?""
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, fucked around and got a triple double
Freakin' niggas every way, like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day

Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas
And watch me break 'em with the 7, 7-11, 7-11
7, even back door Little Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin': ""Domino!""
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central LA
Today was a good day

Left my nigga's house paid
Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my dick runs deep, so deep
So deep put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
No helicopter lookin' for a murder
Two in the morning, got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read ""Ice Cube's a Pimp"" (Yeah)
Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
Halfway home and my pager still blowin' up
Today I didn't even have to use my AK
I gotta say, it was a good day

Hey, wait, wait a minute!
Pooh, stop this shit!
What the fuck am I thinkin' about?"

Them they got moved by these hard-rock Brooklyn kids
Us floor rush when the DJ's booming classics
You, dig the crew on the fattest hip-hop records
He touch the kinks and sinks into the sounds
She frequents the fattest joints caught underground
Our funk zooms like you hit the Mary Jane
They flock to booms man boogie had to change
Who freaks the clips with mad amount percussion
Where kinky hair goes to unthought-of dimensions
Why's it so fly cause hip-hop kept some drama
When Butterfly rocked his light blue-suede Pumas
What by the cut we push it off the corner
How was the buzz entire hip hop era
Was fresh and fat since they started saying outtie
Cause funks made fat from right beneath my hoodie
The poobah of the styles like Miles and shit
Like sixties funky worms with waves and perms
Just sendin' junky rhythms right down ya block
We be to rap what key be to lock
But
I'm cool like dat
I'm cool like dat
I'm cool like dat
I'm cool like dat
I'm cool like dat
I'm cool like dat
I'm cool like dat
I'm cool

We be the chocolates taps on my raps
She innovates at the sweeter cat naps
He at the funk club with the vibrate
Them they be crazy down with the five Nat'
It can kick a plan then a crowd burst
Me I be digging it with a bump verse
Us we be freaking til dawn blinks an eye
He gives the strangest smile so I say hi (wassup)
Who understood, yeah understood the plans
Him heard a beat and put it to his hands
What I just flip let borders get loose
How to consume or they'll be just like juice
If it's the shit we'll lift it off the plastic
The babes'll go spastic, Hip hop gains a classic
Pimp playing shock it don't matter I'm fatter
Ask Butta how I zone (man, Cleopatra Jones)
And
I'm chill like dat
I'm chill like dat
I'm chill like dat
I'm chill like dat
I'm chill like dat
I'm chill like dat
I'm chill like dat
I'm chill

Blink..blink..blink..blink..blink..blink..blink....
Think..think..think..think..think..think..think...

We getcha free cause the clips be fat boss
Them they're the jams and commence to going off
She sweats the beat and ask me cause she puffed it
Me I got crew kids seven and a crescent
Us cause a buzz when the nickel bags are dealt
Him, that's my man with the asteroid belt
They catch a fizz from the Mr. Doodle-big
He rocks a tee from the Crooklyn nine-pigs
The rebirth of slick like my gangsta stroll
The lyrics just like loot come in stacks and rolls
You used to find a Bug in a box with fade
Now he boogies up your stage plaits twist or braids
And
I'm peace like dat
I'm peace like dat
I'm peace like dat
I'm peace like dat
I'm peace like dat
I'm peace like dat

It sounds like it's serious because we can't concentrate and get this right
So, let's deal with the problem
You see, I've been through this myself, and, let's talk
And it goes a little something like this - hit it
Mmm...

Baby girl (unfair but true)
Can love him once but not twice
Who plays games with no rules (a fool)
Tears for fears (are no surprise)
Happens almost every time
Love knocks you on your behind
(Loved you hard, loved you long, now his love is gone)
Love 'em and leave 'em (is the rule of most dogs)
You must be strong
Stand up on your own
Take control of your life

I've seen it time and time again
It's not worth it, no
Don't be down and miserable
You and only you
Can bring yourself around

Give it up, turn it loose
Oh, if he don't want ya, you don't need 'em, girl, yeah
Give it up, turn it loose
Oh, yeah

Fact of life (so sad but true)
Love can often hurt you
Leaving scars most of your life (nightmares can haunt you)
But fairytales of love can come true
Both play tricks on your mind
(You'll be fine, take this time to find piece of mind)
Sooner or later (bad feelings will die)
You must be strong
Don't blame it all on love
In time good things will come

I've seen it time and time again
It's not worth it, no no
Don't be down and miserable
You and only you
Can bring yourself around

Give it up, turn it loose
Oh, if he don't want ya, you don't need 'em, girl... yeah
Give it up, turn it loose
Oh, yeah

(Give it up) Give it up, oh
(Give up) Give it up
(Give up) Give it up
(Give it up, turn it loose) Turnin' it loose, baby
(Give up) Give it up
(Give up) Give it up
(Give it up, turn it loose) Turnin' it loose, baby
(Give up) Give it, give it, give it, give it
(Give up) Give it, give it, give it, give it
(Give it up, turn it loose) And turn it loose

Somethin' real smooth, hahaha
You can just ride to
Tell me how you feel
Here we go...

Hold tight, hold tight, say we haffi hold tight...
Hold tight, hold tight, say we haffi hold tight...
Tell them Mista Cat, and him haffi hold tight
Tell them Kriss Kross, everyting is alright
Come in the place and you feeling right
They come in the place and you hold your girl tight
Tell them Mista Cat, him a DJ tonight
Say hold tight, tight and everyting is alright

The day seems nice and bright and everything feels alright
Went to school without a fool tryin' to pick a fight
I was loced out Kris Kross shirts and khakis
(Lookin' and feelin' like nothin' but a Mac, see...)
The bell rang and I got my dash
Fellin' good cause it was the last day of school, and I passed
No moms trippin', so me and my mom went dippin'
To celebrate the fact that I wasn't slippin'
The downtown scene was packed
People screamin' from they ride to my ride and to the Mac
I says ""I am what I am, that's who I be""
And yall should have seen how they was tryin' to get to me
Cool, cause dissin' and no pay
They're the reason why we are who we are to this very day
And all that love keeps me and Chris tight
Long as we give some love back everything's alright

Hold tight, hold tight, tell 'em haffi hold tight...
Hold tight, hold tight, tell 'em haffi hold tight...
Tell them Mista Cat, and him haffi hold tight
Tell them Kriss Kross, everyting is alright
Come in the place and you feeling right
They come in the place and you hold your girl tight
Tell them Mista Cat, him a DJ tonight
Say hold tight, tight and everyting is alright

Now everything feels alright when I'm rollin' through my hood
And I see the one that used to do the dirt then turned good
Little kids try to be like me...
(With the braids, the shades, some pants and some Nikes, G)
And nothin' mo' better then a letter sayin'
""I'm your number one fan could you write me back man?"" Yesssss!
I try to pass 'em my autograph
I try to do as many as I can
Now it feels good when I'm rollin' through my hood
Ain't nobody dissin' and a nigga thinks he's too good
Cause I'm down like four flat tires
(Just a little nappy headed kid from the proj)
Showin' I can do right and not do wrong
Representin BG's and comin' up strong, and...
(We ain't got no love for the side)
We only love those who love us back, right?

Hold tight, hold tight, tell 'em haffi hold tight...
Hold tight, hold tight, tell 'em haffi hold tight...
Tell them Mista Cat, and him haffi hold tight
Tell them Kriss Kross, everyting is alright
Come in the place and you feeling right
They come in the place and you hold your girl tight
Tell them Mista Cat, him a DJ tonight
Say hold tight, tight and everyting is alright

Now people seem to think what I do is a blast
Cause I'm always on the road and I'm makin' some cash
But they don't know, really d'know
The pressure it is for some kids tryin to make it in this here biz
Early mornin' interviews then we step to school
Step from school, back to interviews then it's on to other dues
So, warm it up Chris?
I said ""Ya warm it up Chris?""
That's what I was born to do!

Now throw your hands in the air and wave from side-to-side
If the feelin' thatcha feelin', is the feelin' of pride
See, I ain't come out wack I came out right
Unlike those moles who tried to ""Pass Da Mic""
It's the Daddy Mac (Big baby!)
Everything is real but you wanna diss cause a nigga sold a couple mill
(Look here...) Ya can't say nothin' if ya last in a line
So when you diss it just lets me know I'm on your mind, and it's alright

Hold tight, hold tight, every posse hold tight
Hold tight, hold tight, every posse hold tight
It no matter if you‚Äôre black, it no matter if you‚Äôre white
Just come in de house make we all unite
Tell dem Kriss Kross and dem a drop on de mic and make we dance until the morning light
Tell dem Kriss Kross a de people‚Äôs choice we haffi dance until de day light
Your girl inna de place and your hold her tight and dance to the people‚Äôs choice
Tell dem Kriss Kross dem a tear down de mic, dance hard cause the vibes is right

Break it down again

So those are my dreams
And these are my eyes
Stand tall like a man
Headstrong like a horse

When it's all mixed up
Better break it down
In the world of secrets
In the world of sound

It's in the way you're always hiding from the light
See for yourself, you have been sitting on a time bomb
No revolution, maybe someone somewhere else
Could show you something new about you and your inner song
And all the love and all the love in the world
Won't stop the rain from falling, waste seeping underground
Break it down again
I want to break it down
Break it down again
Break it down again

So those are my schemes
And these are my plans
Hot tips for the boys
Fresh news from the force

When it's all mixed up
Better break it down
In the world of silence
In the world of sound

""No sleep for dreaming"" say the architects of life
Big bouncing babies, bread and butter - can I have a slice?
They make no mention of the beauty of decay
Blue, yellow, pink umbrella save it for a rainy day
And all the love and all the love in the world
Won't stop the rain from falling, waste seeping underground
Break it down again
I want to break it down
Break it down again


Horsing around
Pray to the power, play to the crowd with your big hit sound
And they won't simmer, won't simmer, won't simmer down
Play to the crowd, play to the crowd
Play, yeah, yeah

It's in the way you're always hiding from the light
Fast off to heaven just like Moses on a motorbike
No revolution, maybe someone somewhere else
Could show you something new to help you
With the ups and downs
Break it down again
I want to break it down
Break it down again
Break it down again
Break it down again
Break it down again
Here we go!

Break it down again
No more sleepy dreaming
No more building up
It is time to dissolve
Break it down it again
No more sleepy dreaming"

Why don't you, sit right back
And I, I may tell you, a tale
A tale of three, little pigs
And a big, bad, wolfff
Well the first little piggy, well he was kinda hip
He spent most of his days, just a dreamin of the city
And then one day, he bought a guitar
He moved to Hollywood, to become a star
But, living on the farm, he knew nothing of the city
Built his house out of straw, what a pity
And then one day, jammin on some chords
Along came the wolf, knocking on his door

Little Pig, Little Pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!!
Little Pig, Little Pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!!
Well I'm huffin, I'm puffin, I'll blow your house in
Huffin, puffin, blow your house in
Huffin, puffin, blow your house in
Huffin and a puffin and I'll blow your house in!!!
Well the second little piggy, well he was kinda stoked
He spent most of his time just a ganga smokin
Huffin and a puffin down on Venice Beach
Getting paid money for religious speech
He built his shelter from what he garbage picked
Mostly made up of old cans and sticks
Then one day he was cranking out Bob Marley
And along came the Wolf on his big bad Harley

Well the third little piggy, the grade A student
His daddy was a rock star, named Pig Nugent
Earned his Masters Degree, from Harvard College
Built his house from his architect knowledge
A tri-level mansion, Hollywood Hills
Daddy's rock stardom, paid for the bills
And then one day came the old house smasher
The big bad wolf the little piggy slasher

Well the big bad Wolf
Well he huffed, and he puffed, all that he could
And low and behold the little piggy's house stood
""IT'S MADE OUT OF CONCRETE!"" the little piggy shouted
The wolf just frowned, as he pouted
So they called nine-eleven, like any piggy would
The sent out rambo, just as fast, as they could
(Rambo)
""YO, WOLF-FACE, I'M YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE, YOUR ASS IS MINE!!!""
(gunshots)
Well the wolf fell dead as you can plainly see
So that's to end the story, for you and me
If you still give a listen, you just may, here a big wolf or little piggy
Say
(Chorus )
"" And the moral of the story is, ' A band with no talent can easily amuse
Idiots, with a stupid, puppet show. """

You could say I lost my belief in the holy church

If I ever lose my faith in you
There'd be nothing left for me to do

Some would say I was a lost man in a lost world
You could say I lost my faith in the people on TV
You could say I'd lost my belief in our politicians
They all seemed like game show hosts to me

If I ever lose my faith in you
There'd be nothing left for me to do

I could be lost inside their lies without a trace
But every time I close my eyes I see your face

I never saw no miracle of science
That didn't go from a blessing to a curse
I never saw no military solution
That didn't always end up as something worse but
Let me say this first

Made it clear suddenly

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeah
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeah
(All that she wants)
(All that she wants)

So if you are in sight and the day is right
She's the hunter, you're the fox
The gentle voice that talks to you won't talk forever
It is a night for passion
But the morning means goodbye
Beware of what is flashing in her eyes
She's going to get you

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeah
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby (Is one more baby, yeah)
Ahhh, ahh

All that she wants is another baby (Is one more baby)
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby (Is one more baby)

Alright
Come on now
Yeah
Talk to me
Yeah

Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Gotta say it again now
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Yes he is
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Yeah

I wanna take a minute or two, and give much respect due
To the man that's made a difference in my world
And although most men are ho's he flows on the down low
'Cause I never heard about him with another girl
But I don't sweat it because it's just pathetic
To let it get me involved in that he said/she said crowd
I know that ain't nobody perfect, I give props to those who deserve it
And believe me y'all, he's worth it
So here's to the future cuz we got through the past
I finally found somebody that can make me laugh
(Ha ha ha) You so crazy
I think I wanna have your baby

Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Yes, he is
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
He's a  mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
You gotta say it again now
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Heeh

My man is smooth like Barry, and his voice got bass
A body like Arnold with a Denzel face
He's smart like a doctor with a real good rep
And when he comes home he's relaxed with Pep
He always got a gift for me everytime I see him
A lot of snot-nosed ex-flames couldn't be him
He never ran a corny line once to me yet
So I give him stuff that he'll never forget
He keeps me on Cloud Nine just like the Temps
He's not a fake wannabe tryin' to be a pimp
He dresses like a dapper don, but even in jeans
He's a God-sent original, the man of my dreams

Yes, my man says he loves me, never says he loves me not
Tryin' to rush me good and touch me in the right spot
See other guys that I've had, they tried to play all that mac (shit)
But every time they tried I said, ""That's not it""
But not this man, he's got the right potion
Baby, rub it down and make it smooth like lotion
Yeah, the ritual, highway to heaven
From seven to seven he's got me open like Seven Eleven
And yes, it's me that he's always choosin'
With him I'm never losin', and he knows that my name is not Susan
He always has heavy conversation for the mind
Which means a lot to me cuz good men are hard to find

Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
He's a  mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Say it again now
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Ohh, uuuh
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
I said what a mighty good man
You know what I'm sayin', he's a mighty mighty good man
Y'all hear me, now check it out

My man gives real loving that's why I call him Killer
He's not a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am, he's a thriller
He takes his time and does everything right
Knocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night
He's a real smooth brother, never in a rush
And he gives me goose pimples with every single touch
Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood cuz he's a real man
A lover and a fighter and he'll knock a knucker out
Don't take him for a sucker cuz that's not what he's about
Every time I need him, he always got my back
Never disrespectful cuz his mama taught him that
I've got a good man

Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
A mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Yes he is
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
What a mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man
What a mighty mighty good man
Tell me like that sugar
Now break it down
I break it down one time
Whatta man, whatta man
Whatta man, whatta man
Whatta man, whatta man"

2916,16,Without You / Never Forget You,Mariah Carey,1994,without you  never forget you,mariah carey,,,1,"OPENING THEME
Luke goes on a a run around Manhattan as Trish Talk plays in the background.
TRISH: If you're just joining us, this is Trish Talk and we are discussing the recent events that have the residents of Harlem confused, and some even frightened. Line one. Sophia, you're on the air.
SOPHIA: Luke Cage is turning the neighborhood upside down and giving it a good shake. Trust me, no one wants to see what falls out.
TRISH: Are you suggesting we turn a blind eye to the problems in our city?
SOPHIA: No, but I seen the news.
The man is so strong, he doesn't have to answer to anybody. Can you trust a person like that? Let the police do their jobs. That's what I say.
TRISH: Some would argue the boys in blue don't exactly have a sterling reputation these days.
SOPHIA:  Oh, yeah, missy? Well, the next time trouble comes banging at your door, maybe you should call Luke Cage instead of 911.
TRISH: You know what, Sophia? I just might. Uh, let's take another caller. Line two. Hi, Amir.
AMIR: Hey, Trish, I want to respond to that lady 'cause she's got it all wrong. I know Luke. He comes into the fish fry. Always treats my wife and me with respect. Last week, two kids started a fight, Luke took care of it and nobody got hurt.
TRISH: I think it's noteworthy that the only people I've spoken to that criticize are the ones who don't know him personally. So many others have merely read about him or saw him on the news and jumped to conclusions.
AMIR: Trish, Luke is good people and he belongs right here in Harlem.
TRISH: And I think it's important for all of us to realize something. We are witnessing a massive shift in the boundaries of possibility. But what is scary to some inspires hope in others. I, for one, would like to thank Luke Cage for all the work he's doing in Harlem. Those of us below 110th see the good work he's doing and we hope he's doing well.
THE WATERFRONT
Cottonmouth, sans minions, meets Scarfe.
COTTONMOUTH: I never thought I'd be happy to see your ugly face.
SCARFE: Well, we all can't be as pretty as you.
COTTONMOUTH: Ain't that the truth. You got the goods?
SCARFE: You know me. I always come correct. It's all piled up in there, just waiting for you.
COTTONMOUTH: So we're squared up?
SCARFE: Mmm, nah. We ain't square. We a few zeroes off. About $100,000 worth.
COTTONMOUTH: I'm not givin' you another dime.
SCARFE: Good. I don't need another dime. I need $100,000. No cash, no guns. No guns, no Domingo. The ghetto CNN is workin' overtime. If you don't make it straight with Domingo, you're done. Plus I got all your cash in lockup. Oops.
COTTONMOUTH: Think about how you want to spend the rest of your life, Detective.
SCARFE: Shit! Man, your juice is water since Luke Cage punked your peacock ass.
Cottonmouth punches Scarfe in the face. Scarfe tries to take out his gun, but Cottonmouth forces it out of his hand and shoots him in the gut.
SCARFE: You shot a cop!
A MAN ACROSS THE RIVER: Hey, what's goin' on over there? Hey, man, you all right?
COTTONMOUTH: When I catch you, I'm gonna use my hands, bitch.
Cottonmouth gets in his car and drives away.
IN FRONT OF MARIAH'S BROWNSTONE
Mariah is recording something for television.
MARIAH: I believe in Harlem. You know, my Harlem is saturated with jazz, and good food, and the pure genius that permeates the streets. Harlem is risin' like a phoenix out of the ashes. I mean, that's what all of my various complexes is about, is restoring that luster.
Luke Cage approaches Mariah from across the street.
CAMERAMAN: Fantastic. Uh, you mind if we go in now, Madam Councilwoman? The crew needs to set up for later.
MARIAH: Yeah, of course, of course.
Go on.
LUKE: Your new VH1 show? ""Criminal Spinsters?
MARIAH: Who you callin' a spinster? I'd wear your narrow ass out. What's this about?
LUKE: Your cousin. I'm shutting him down. You, too.
MARIAH: Are you threatening me?
LUKE: Never that.
Luke puts his hood up and walks away. The cameramen return.
MARIAH: Ah! Come on. Let's go inside.
SOLEDAD'S DINER
LUKE: I ain't no barber, Bobby.
FISH: Neither am I, Luke. But we both agree that Harlem is a better place with the shop open.
LUKE: As soon as I put Cottonmouth in handcuffs, I'm ghost.
FISH: You could make a career out of robbing bad guys. Huh!
LUKE: That would be the perfect grind, wouldn't it?
FISH: You ever think about playing for the Giants? You could make that squad easy.
LUKE: Being hood famous is bad enough. I couldn't be in the public eye on that kind of level. Nah, man.
FISH: Wear a mask.
LUKE: What for? I ain't no hero.
FISH: That's a great slogan. ""I ain't no hero. Pay me."" You could market that shit.
COTTONMOUTH'S OFFICE
MARIAH: What do you mean you shot him, Cornell? Cornell! How could you be so stupid? You didn't have to shoot him.
COTTONMOUTH: And just let him stick me for a hundred large? Hell no. It wasn't like I went to the meeting strapped. It was his gun that busted off.
MARIAH: But you went there alone because you knew you were wrong. This is insane. If he lives, everything that you have built will come crashing down. And you are not dragging me down with you. You hearin' me?
COTTONMOUTH: My guys are pickin' up the guns right now. We'll hand them over to Domingo tonight.
MARIAH: I don't want the details. I just want results.
COTTONMOUTH: You want results? I don't work for you.
MARIAH: Okay, forget the cops. The cops are bad enough. What about Luke Cage?
COTTONMOUTH: Isn't your interview today? That's where your focus should be. Givin' off that Geoffrey Canada vibe, for real. That's where the money is.
MARIAH: Oh, forget the money, Cornell. Forget the club. Sell it! Walk away from all this shit. People are still talking about how tall you stood at Pop's memorial.
COTTONMOUTH: I'm proud of you, cousin. I really am. But I can take care of myself.
MARIAH: You need to take his ass out.
COTTONMOUTH: It ain't that easy. Cage is bulletproof. I've seen it myself. It's real.
MARIAH: Does the nigga have gills?
COTTONMOUTH: Excuse me?
MARIAH: Drown him. Can he burn? Can you poison him? What about a woman? You know he got one with his fine ass. You find his weakness and you squeeze.
COTTONMOUTH: You soundin' a lot like Mama Mabel. Don't worry about Cage. His days are numbered. I got something for him. That's my word.
THE STATIONHOUSE, PEREZ'S OFFICE
HIS OFFICE
COTTONMOUTH: My niggas loaded up the stash right before the cops arrived.
PEREZ (over the phone): What the hell happened?
COTTONMOUTH: Detective Scarfe tried to squeeze me for 100 grand. You put him up to that shit?
PEREZ: Hell no. Of course not. Let me, uh, let me speak to him. Where's he at?
COTTONMOUTH: Bleedin' and in the wind.
PEREZ (over the phone): You know what you just did, right? There's no easy way out of this, man.
COTTONMOUTH: Why do you think we're talking?
SOLEDAD'S DINER
Claire comes in and speaks to her mother by the door. Luke and Fish are still eating.
CLAIRE: This is why you need to learn how to text.
SOLEDAD: You always think the worst.
CLAIRE: What do you need, Mami?
SOLEDAD: Not me, you.
Soledad indicates Luke and Fish at their table. Claire heads over to them.
CLAIRE: Luke?
LUKE: Yes?
CLAIRE: Oh. You probably don't remember me, do you? Your girlfriend had me take care of you when you were brought into the hospital? In Hell's Kitchen?
LUKE: Hey. Hey.
FISH: Bobby. Bobby Fish.
CLAIRE: I'm sorry. Claire. Very nice to meet you.
FISH: Well, Claire, you you are far too beautiful to ever apologize for anything. You remember that.
Bobby lays down some money for his food and leaves.
CLAIRE: May I?
LUKE: Please...You didn't have to do what you did for me.
CLAIRE: Have you ever saved anyone's life before? More than once I'm betting.
LUKE: So?
CLAIRE: So, the only thing you can think about afterwards is if they're okay. That's all I wanted to know.
LUKE: Well I'm still here.
CLAIRE: How? That shotgun blast alone should've turned your brain into mush.
LUKE: So I'm a freak.
CLAIRE: No. You're amazing.
LUKE: I don't wanna be different than anybody else.
CLAIRE: Why hide it? I mean, what are you gonna do with it?
LUKE: I gotta go.
Luke leaves, and Claire gets up to leave too.
SOLEDAD: Text me later.
CLAIRE: Okay.
THE STATIONHOUSE
CAPTAIN: Listen up! I'm hearin' a lot of whispers and rumors concerning Detective Scarfe and what he might've been into. Kill that noise. We need him back alive. There was a trail of his blood at the scene. His car riddled with bullets. We don't know what the hell happened. Focus on that. I'm putting out an APB. We're closing streets, tunnels, puttin' up road blocks. Whatever it takes. But remember something. This belongs in our shop. No one else's. Now, there's already too many new faces here, far as I'm concerned. And there're only gonna be more. We need to be the ones to bring him home. Let's do it.
Misty drifts over to her photo wall.
PEREZ: How, uh how you holdin' up?
MISTY: I'd be doin' a lot better if people would stop starin' at me like I'm dirty.
CAPTAIN: What do you know, Detective? Scarfe must have told you something. There's evidence that guns from the junkyard shoot-out were in that warehouse.
MISTY: Stolen from our evidence locker?
PEREZ: Your partner is my top suspect.
MISTY: It doesn't mean Scarfe did it. He probably got a lead, and went to go and check it out.
CAPTAIN: Alone. Without pulling you in on a single detail. Are you sure you don't know where to find him?
MISTY: If I knew, I would tell you. So is that how we're playing this, Captain? Like Scarfe is a suspect and not a victim?
CAPTAIN: He could be both or either. We won't know until you guys bring him in.
MISTY: Us?
CAPTAIN: I need my best on this, Detective. That was you and Scarfe. Now I need you and Perez to find our boy.
MISTY: Yes, ma'am.
OUTSIDE THE BARBERSHOP
Luke and Claire are walking together.
LUKE: You can disappear. The whole point of livin' in New York, no one cares about anybody.
CLAIRE: A building fell on you. People are shooting at you. And you walk around without a scratch. Who's gonna ignore all that?...What's wrong?
LUKE: It's supposed to be locked. Bobby? Are you in here, man?
Luke notices a trail of blood and follows it into the back room. Scarfe is collapsed against the washing machine.
LUKE: Scarfe?
SCARFE: No cops. Not even Misty.
LUKE: Why me?
SCARFE: 'Cause you don't trust us.
CLAIRE: We need to get him to a hospital.
SCARFE: No, I can't go to the hospital. They'll kill me. Just like they did Chico. They found him, they'll find me.
CLAIRE: He's lost a lot of blood. Help me get him into the chair. Now.
close up of Claire cutting fabric away from Scarfe's wound. Luke places something at her side.
CLAIRE: Just right here, thank you.
LUKE: Bobby just bought these chairs. He's gonna be pissed.
SCARFE'S APARTMENT
Misty pictures Scarfe coming into his shappy, empty apartment and grabbing a beer. Cut back to reality: she and Perez are investigating the apartment.
PEREZ: You are a weirdo. People at the precinct talk about you like you are curandera or some shit. Like you see things.
MISTY: You remember Where's Waldo? That was me as a kid. And I could find Waldo faster than anybody. That's what a photograph does for me. A photograph freezes time. It allows you to look at things, slow down, think about what's out of place, and then fill in the blanks. That's how you find Waldo.
PEREZ: Maybe you should work for Kodak. That was deep.
MISTY: Whatever. His clothes are still here, right?
PEREZ: Yeah.
MISTY: So, if he wasn't taken, there's a chance he might come back. We should stake it out for a while.
PEREZ: Never would have thought Scarfe would be cute as a kid.
MISTY: That's not Scarfe. That's his son, Earl.
PEREZ: Never knew he had a kid.
MISTY: Earl's dead. Scarfe forgot to lock up his gun one night. Earl found it and accidentally shot himself...Scarfe cracks a lot of jokes, but he rarely smiles. There's a difference.
MARIAH'S BROWNSTONE
Mariah is nervous, getting ready for her interview. She accidentally jostles a photo of Mama Mabel.
MARIAH: Oh! Shut it! Dusty old bitch.
She gathers herself and goes back to putting on her lip gloss.
THE BARBERSHOP
CLAIRE: Okay. I can remove the bullet from his thigh but the shot in his side is worse. If the bullet pierced his liver, he's gonna have internal bleeding, and I can't do anything about that here.

LUKE (to Scarfe): Give me one good reason I shouldn't dump you at the 29th.
SCARFE: I told you, man. They're trying to kill me.
CLAIRE: No, no, no. Don't move. Don't get up. Stay right here. Hold.
SCARFE: Who the hell is this?
CLAIRE: I'm the woman trying to save your life.
SCARFE: Thank you, whatever.
Claire holds a lighter over a pair of tweezers and gets ready to take the bullet out of Scarfe's thigh.
CLAIRE: Well, this is gonna sting a lot.

SCARFE: Ah! God! I think I'm gonna have to stay, lay low here for a little while.
LUKE: No. Not until you tell me what's goin' on.
Claire is still rooting around in Scarfe's thigh.
SCARFE: I can't tell you anything right now.
Claire finally gets it out.
SCARFE: Okay. It was Cottonmouth. He was behind everything.
LUKE: So you've been working for him the whole time?
SCARFE: Yeah. I got his guns out of lockup for him, and then he turns around and tries to kill me. Go figure.
LUKE: What makes you think I can protect you?
SCARFE: You survived a drive-by and a building fallin' on your head. I'd say you're overqualified.
LUKE: You mentioned Chico before you passed out. What happened to Chico?
SCARFE: I told you. They killed him.Don't  lie to me. Not now.
SCARFE: Okay...I killed him.
Luke grabs Scarfe by the throat and starts to squeeze.
CLAIRE Luke. Don't. Please. You're not a killer, are you?
Luke reluctantly lets go.
LUKE: We're done. Let's go.
SCARFE: Hey, Cage! Cage! Wait! I'm an asshole! There's no disputing that. I am a despicable human being. But Cottonmouth is a hell of a lot worse! And I have got what it takes to put him behind bars for the rest of his life!
LUKE: What did you say?
SCARFE: I can take him down.
LUKE: What do you have? [
SCARFE: Notes. Detailed notes of murder investigations I covered up to save his ass. How he uses Spurlock's Mortuary to dispose of the bodies. Why do you think you never found Tone? Or Chico? Plus I've got the name of every cop on Cottonmouth's payroll. That ought to be plenty to send him on a nice permanent trip.
LUKE: Where are these notes? Tell me. Now.
SCARFE: My apartment.
Luke zips up his hoodie and takes to the street.
MARIAH'S BROWNSTONE
MARIAH: Alex, no one goes in the back. And make sure these people don't scuff up my floors.
ALEX: They will stay immaculate, Madam Councilwoman.
THEMBI: So, since this will be a live interview, we'll try to keep things spontaneous. But are there any topics you want to focus on?
MARIAH: Well, Harlem. How to shape it, how to elevate it, and...how my complexes will help
THEMBI: Boring. We've heard that speech from you a million times and a half.
MARIAH: I told you I do not want a fluff piece.
THEMBIE: Not fluff, fun. There's a difference. Remember when Obama sang Al Green?
MARIAH: You wanna watch me whip and nae nae, Thembi?
OUTSIDE SCARFE'S APARTMENT
Perez is sending text after text.
MISTY: You're a popular man.
PEREZ: Oh, uh the ex-wife. Took all my money and she still needs the dick.
MISTY: Glad to see chivalry isn't dead.
PEREZ: Look, look, look, Scarfe's not comin'. He's not gonna show up just to get arrested.
Two people outside Scarfe's apartment get into a heated altercation.
MISTY: Look at these two...I think she's about to...
PEREZ: She's gonna knock him out.
MISTY: Maybe you should go arrest them.
Using the argument as a cover, Luke cage slips into Scarfe's building. He breaks the door handle and leaves it swinging open. He busts open the door to Scarfe's apartment in the same way.
MISTY: I don't know if you remember me ten years ago, when I first got bumped up off patrol?
PEREZ: Yeah. It didn't seem like you belonged. No offense.
MISTY: None taken. A lot of people wrote me off back then. But not Scarfe. He took me under his wing. He taught me how to police for real. I have no idea what he saw in me back then, but he has had my front and my back.
Luke makes his way through Scarfe's apartment, eventually finding the loose floorboards that hide his notes.
MISTY: If he's clean or not I wanna be the one to bring him in, ask him his side of the story. I owe him that much.
PEREZ: We're wasting our time. Let's go.
Misty notices the swinging door.
MISTY: Somebody's in there.
PEREZ: No, no way Scarfe got past us.
MISTY: Well, somebody did.
They rush up the stairs and get into the apartment just as Luke jumps out the window and lands with asphalt-shattering force in the alley below. Misty looks out the window in time to see him running away.
MISTY: Hey! Hey!
Misty and Perez leave the apartment and head back down the stairs.
THE BARBERSHOP
CLAIRE: Hey, hey, hey, don't fall asleep, okay? You need to stay conscious. We're gonna move soon.
Luke comes in the door. Claire has a weapon ready but lowers it when she sees who it is.
LUKE: The cops just saw me at Scarfe's place, they'll be headed here any minute.
SCARFE: Misty?
LUKE: Yeah it was her.
CLAIRE: He can't really walk.
LUKE: I'll carry him.
CLAIRE: Where?
LUKE: The only place this evidence makes a difference. I just need to get a car. I'll try and grab a cab.
CLAIRE: No, no, no, I have a better idea.
LUKE: Claire...
CLAIRE: Mami, ¬øC√≥mo est√°s? I texted you. Did you get it? Our ride's here. Yeah. No, no, no, just come around the back. No. Around the back. Okay.
Luke picks Scarfe up and carries him to the back exit, where Soledad's catering van is waiting.
CLAIRE:Here's our ride.
LUKE: You gotta be kidding me.
Luke drops Scarfe in the back
SCARFE: Oh! Careful, man.
SOLEDAD (to Luke): The van is one thing. If my daughter gets scratched, I'll kill you. I don't care how bulletproof you are.
LUKE: She's safe with me. I promise.
CLAIRE: Can we drop you at home?
SOLEDAD: No, I'm fine.
CLAIRE: Muchas gracias, Mami.
SOLEDAD: De nada.
LUKE: You good?
CLAIRE: Yeah.
LUKE: I'll drive.
CLAIRE: Obviously.
They start driving. Scarfe seems to be getting worse.
CLAIRE: He really needs surgery. How far are we going?
LUKE: Downtown to One Police Plaza.
CLAIRE: Police headquarters?
LUKE: Yeah, I'm gonna hand him and the evidence over. The DA can take it from there. Get him round-the-clock protection until he can testify against Cottonmouth.
SCARFE: I'm dying back here. You're still thinking about Cottonmouth?
LUKE: Yeah, you should be, too. If he's got as many cops working for him as you say, he'll have them in the streets looking for us. Call an EMT you can trust to meet us there.
MARIAH'S BROWNSTONE
THEMBI: I want to remind the viewers that we're live. Call us using the number at the bottom of your screen. I know the councilwoman would love to answer your questions. Madam Councilwoman, your home is stunning.
MARIAH: Oh, thank you, Thembi. That's why people are paying millions of dollars for brownstones like this one on Convent Avenue. I mean, these buildings must be preserved and protected.
THEMBI: Let's talk politics. Let's talk Damon Boone.
MARIAH: Yes. That Stanford-educated carpetbagger has been saying things about my voting record, about campaign finance, that simply are not true. My complexes will do for black-owned real estate what Geoffrey Canada has done for education uptown. I'm just setting the record straight.
THE BARBERSHOP:
Perez and Misty are surveying the makeshift clinic.
PEREZ: Someone saw a green van parked around the back. We got partial plates.
MISTY: Well, let's hope we get a hit on it.
Perez's cell phone starts to ring.
MISTY: Otherwise, I'm not sure where else to look. And what in the hell is taking those damn unis so long to get here?
Perez waits for Misty to leave the shop before he answers the phone.
PEREZ: Yeah?...I get that. I get it, but we ran into a problem.
Cut to Cottonmouth on the phone in his office.
COTTONMOUTH: And what the hell was Luke Cage doing with Detective Scarfe? Do I need to remind you? If Scarfe talks, I ain't the only one going down, Lieutenant Perez. Half the department's coming with me. Find him!
Cottonmouth throws his cell against the wall.
ZIP (from the doorway): Where's Shades?
COTTONMOUTH: I don't know.
ZIP: Let me step up. What you need?
COTTONMOUTH: And how'd that work out last time?
ZIP: You got a choice?
COTTONMOUTH:Put the word out on the street. A hundred large for Detective Scarfe. I want him dead. Dead. Dead. Look for a green van. Plate's 69-somethin'.
ON THE ROAD
Some of Cottonmouth's people are out looking for the van.
DIONTEY: We're near the barber shop. We'll head that way. Bring him to you or Mr. Stokes?
ON A DIFFERENT ROAD
LUKE: Traffic sucks.
CLAIRE: There's a police checkpoint up ahead. Next couple of blocks, actually.
LUKE: Scarfe's people are looking for us. They're probably closing the whole island down. Bridges, tunnels...
SCARFE: That's the way I would've done it.
CLAIRE: Don't take 128.
LUKE: Which way?
CLAIRE: Make a sharp right...Hang on.
DIONTEY: Hold on. You seen that? Hold on, I think that was it...Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Zip I think I just saw the van.
And the name was right. What color did Cottonmouth say that van was, though? -
DRIVER: Blue.
DIONTEY: Green, nigga. Yo, I'm on them right now.
LUKE: Looks like we got company.
SCARFE: Is it a squad car?
LUKE: Black SUV. I'll slow down and see if he passes.
When Luke slows down the SUV drives up along side them and riders fire into the car. Luke turns down a side street.
DIONTEY: Back up! Move!
LUKE: Hold on back there!
DIONTEY: There he is! Stay on him!
Eventually Luke slides into an alley.
LUKE: Kill the lights.
However, Diontey and crew still see them.
DIONTEY: There he is!
They get out a bunch of guns and all empty their clips into the parked van.
DIONTEY: Light his ass up!
They open up the van only to find that Luke busted through the side of the van and into the adjacent building.
DIONTEY: Shit! I'm gonna circle around. You three, through the hole. Go, go, go!
A STAKEOUT
PEREZ: What are we doing? We should just head back to the precinct.
MISTY: No. If we hear something, I wanna be ready to go, not stuck behind some damn desk.
PEREZ:Can we at least go to Wendy's? I dig them Frostys, man.
MISTY: Your stomach can wait.
DISPATCH: 10-13 near Bowery. Repeat, shots fired near Bowery.
MISTY: That's right near One Police Plaza.
PEREZ: If they're running, why would they go down there?
MISTY: Maybe they're not running.
Misty turns on their siren; Perez turns it off.
MISTY: What the hell are you doing?
PEREZ: Why do you wanna rush down there?
MISTY: He might need my help.
PEREZ: Shots fired means he resisted arrest. They probably lit his ass up. If he's dirty or not, you don't want to see that. He's still your partner.
Misty answers her phone.
MISTY: Detective Knight.
PEREZ: What's going on?
MISTY: Yeah, I'm trying to head down there right now, but Perez is stopping me.
PEREZ: Who's that?
MISTY: Okay.
PEREZ: Why? Who is that?
MISTY: Okay. I'll do that. Yeah, I'm glad you're okay.
PEREZ: That was Scarfe, wasn't it? What'd he say?
MISTY: Not to trust you. That you're in on all of this.
PEREZ: What? Hell no! You can't believe that rat! He's lying. He's in Cottonmouth's pocket much deeper than I am. Bet...bet you didn't know that, hmm?
Misty holds up her phone and all reveals her recording app.
MISTY: No one was on the phone. Microphone check, five-o. She points her gun at Perez.
PEREZ:You're too smart for your own good. You know that?
MISTY: Yeah, I'd rather be a smart-ass than a dumb-ass. Now give me your gun.
Perez tries to overpower Misty and take her gun. They scuffle, and Perez manages to fire her gun out of the window, but Misty wins out.
MISTY: Uh-huh. Okay, okay. Okay, okay. Now cuff yourself, you piece of shit!
MARIAH'S BROWNSTONE
CAMERAMAN: Roll the video.
MARIAH'S VOICE (from earlier recording): You know, my Harlem is saturated with jazz, and good food, and the pure genius that permeates the streets. Harlem is risin' like a phoenix out of the ashes. I mean, that's what all of my various complexes is about, is restoring that luster.
MARIAH (now): This is great.
MARIAH'S VOICE: I believe in Harlem.
MARIAH (now): This is great. Thanks for taping that earlier. You said you wanted something different. This is it. I mean, you can you can see it all right there. And I don't just represent Harlem. I am Harlem.
CAMERAMAN: And we're live.
THEMBI: Which Harlem is you?
MARIAH: Pardon me?
THEMBI: There are actually two Harlems. The one shown to us in that video. Historic, hardworking and hopeful. But in this next video, we see an entirely different Harlem. A historically corrupt Harlem.
The video is of Mariah's family photos.
THEMBI: Your grandmother, the notorious Mabel Stokes, and her brother-in-law, Pistol Pete Stokes, shown here, were major players in it. The boy in that photo would grow up to be Cornell Stokes, aka Cottonmouth, a man whose name rings out in both legitimate and criminal circles.
MARIAH: Oh, that's a that's a personal photograph. You you really, uh, have no right to show that one.
THEMBI: Well, how about this one?
Video from a news report about the Crispus Attucks attack.
THEMBI: Somehow a brutal assault that took place at the Crispus Attucks Houses didn't make the news. Even stranger was the millions of dollars in cash found on the premises in your office. There's some people on the scene even describe a man who, under a barrage of gunfire, managed to beat down a number of criminals, some of whom may have worked for your family. So you can see how it might be difficult to decipher which Harlem you stand for.
MARIAH: Despite these unwarranted attacks on my character, I have always tried to make clear what I want which I can't say for you, Thembi. It's very clear what you and the rest of your media friends want. You want a story. Not the news. Not the truth. Just a story that you will do anything to sell. Shut it down! Stop. Alex!
THEMBI: Thank you for your time.
MARIAH: You get your ass out of my house.
A CONSTRUCTION SITE, UNDERGROUND
Claire and Luke are carrying Scarfe between them.
LUKE: How long before we get to police headquarters?
SCARFE: I think we're near city hall.
Ah, it's cold. Is it cold, or is it just me?
LUKE: We're close. They'll warm him when we get there.
Diontey and the rest catch up with them and begin firing. Luke blocks the way with his body as Claire and Scarfe keep going.
The gangsters struggle to reload as Luke turns and advances on them.
LUKE: Now you're just pissin' me off. My turn.
The gunfire continues as we cut to Claire and Scarfe.
CLAIRE: We're gonna go up, okay? Come on. One more step.
SCARFE: I'm so tired.
CLAIRE: How far is it to One Police Plaza?
SCARFE: I gotta...I gotta stop now.
CLAIRE: Yeah, we can stop as soon as we get there and we're safe.
SCARFE: I gotta see my son.
CLAIRE: You can see your son and anyone else you want to when we get there.
They emerge into an alley. A car advances on them with the intent to mow them down. Claire braces herself, but the car crashes against something else. She opens her eyes at the same time that Misty arrives on the scene. They both see that Luke Cage stopped the car, crumpling its whole front.
LUKE: You okay?
CLAIRE: Yeah.
LUKE: At least I kept one promise. No scratches on you.
Scarfe crumples to the ground. Misty rushes to his side.
CLAIRE: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold his head.Hold my hand. Look at me. Look at me. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.
MISTY: Hey! Hey. Listen, Scarfe. Okay, you've...you've got a lot of explaining to do, okay? And you're not getting out of it.
SCARFE: You better...You better let me do the interrogation, partner. I'm better...I'm better at it.
MISTY: Oh, you're better at it? No, you're not.
SCARFE: I got rapport.
MISTY: Yeah, you got rapport.
SCARFE: I'm sorry.
MISTY: Rafe, no. Rafe, no. No. No, Rafe. No. No, Rafe, no. No, Rafe, please!
HARLEM'S PARADISE
Misty arrests Cottonmouth in his office.
MARIAH'S BROWNSTONE
Thembi and her cameraman are talking intently in Mariah's living room.
MARIAH: Get the rest of your shit and bugger off.
THEMBI: Councilwoman Dillard, can you comment on the arrest of your cousin, Cornell Stokes, at Harlem's Paradise tonight, on charges of police corruption, extortion and murder?
MARIAH: ...Alex!
THEMBI: Is it true that he's responsible for the murder of decorated Harlem police detective Rafael Scarfe?
ALEX: Thank you for your time!
Alex shepherds them out of the house. Mariah stands frozen.
THEMBI: Councilwoman, can we get a comment? Councilwoman, can we get just one comment? Councilwoman! Councilwoman!
The door closes on the crew.
MARIAH: Shit! Shit!
THE STREETS OF HARLEM
CLAIRE: You need to get some new clothes.
LUKE: I have some stuff back at the crib. This is beginning to become a habit.
CLAIRE: Swiss cheese shirt. Car bounces off of you. Punching through steel and concrete. Just another day, right?
LUKE: You're safe and your mom's van is insured. That's all that matters to me.
CLAIRE: After all that, you can't say you're not special.
LUKE: I'm still not sure what I am.
CLAIRE: You know exactly who you are. And what you need to do.
LUKE: Pop used to say the same thing you're saying to me. I did right by him. Cottonmouth's in jail and I'm done.
CLAIRE: You're moving on?
LUKE: I think so. It's time.
CLAIRE: There's things with your powers you haven't even tested. There's so many good things that you could still do. Maybe I could help.
LUKE: You have ideas?
CLAIRE: Yeah.
LUKE: Why don't we start by getting some coffee first?
CLAIRE: ...I'm not sleeping with you.
LUKE: Whoa! Did I say anything about that? Why can't coffee just be coffee, huh?
CLAIRE: Okay, you didn't even touch your coffee this morning. you drank the orange juice. Okay? You don't drink coffee.
THE STATIONHOUSE
Misty looks at a photo of Scarfe on her desk. In another room several white men and Captain Audrey are conferring. The Captain leaves and stands by Misty.
CAPTAIN: Cowards.
MISTY: What's going on?
CAPTAIN: They're afraid of the headlines. Police corruption. A crime boss who's related to a prominent city councilwoman. And the only person to tie it all together is a corrupt cop. A dead one at that.
MISTY: Then I'll be the one to tie it together.
CAPTAIN: You're on the wrong side of the glass for that, baby girl. First Fisk, then Cottonmouth. This is huge. But they're over there and we're right here."

Der folgende Chatverlauf wird festgehalten und in den kommenden Wochen auf Genius hochgeladen.
So dann fangen wir doch mal ganz sachte an:
Wie geht es dir?
Nika08: Hey :) Hab mir gerade 'ne Kippe angemacht, also gut ^^
VwieVeteran: Na dann hoffe ich mal, dass die Zufriedenheit nicht wie die Zigarette nach der Zeit abklingt.
Du bist neben SinaTheQueen die zweite weibliche Person auf Genius Deutschland, die mindestens Editor ist. F√ºhlst du dich daher in gewisser Ma√üen wie eine Sina 2.0?
Nika08: Da 2.0 ja eigentlich immer ""verbessert"" bedeutet, muss ich diese Frage entschieden verneinen! Ich w√ºrde mich eher als die n√§chste Prinzessin in der Thronfolge unter Sinas Regentschaft sehen, denn sie hat die gr√∂√üeren Br√ºste ;)
VwieVeteran: Interessant!
Wann und wie hattest du denn das K√∂nigreich Genius f√ºr dich entdeckt?
Nika08: Da ich diese Frage schon vermutet habe und ich vorbereitet sein wollte, habe ich vor einigen Tagen mal zu meinen allerersten Activitys gescrollt und jetzt nat√ºrlich alles wieder komplett vergessen^^
Wie ich mich kenne waren aber bestimmt die Lyrics von Genetikk ausschlaggebend daf√ºr, dass ich die Seite entdeckt habe und mich beim durchklicken durch deren gesamte Diskographie n√§her mit Genius befasst habe.
VwieVeteran: Schade. Ich habe gerade voller Vorfreude erwartet nun das genaue Datum deines Eintretens zu erfahren ;)
Nun ja, Genius ist aber vermutlich nicht alles in deinem Leben (wobei deine Twittertimeline das gut und gerne so vermittelt). Was treibst du sonst so?
Nika08: Weil ich wei√ü, dass ich heute Abend nicht einschlafen werde, ehe ich das Datum wei√ü hab' ich gerade schnell nochmal meine Mails durchsucht und siehe da: Meine ""Wassup Nika08! Welcome to Rap Genius""-E-Mail ist am Mittwoch, den 16. April 2014 um 05:40:05 in meiner Mailbox eingegangen. Jetzt kannste dich also doch freuen ;)
Haha ja dieses Twitter habe ich auch vor Kurzem erst f√ºr mich entdeckt, da ich bisher immer der Ansicht war, dass Tweets von mir absolut keine Relevanz f√ºr meine Mitmenschen haben k√∂nnten. Daher r√ºhren die vielen Genius-Tweets, denn die sind - wie wir ja alle wissen - der Inbegriff von Relevanz!
In letzter Zeit wurde ich von neuen Bekanntschaften des √ñfteren nach meiner Freizeitgestaltung neben Genius.com gefragt und, immer etwas peinlich ber√ºhrt, musste ich darauf antworten, dass meine Leidenschaften Musik h√∂ren und schreiben sind = Genius.com xD
VwieVeteran: Du bist die geilste! :D
Nun gehen wir aber mal weg von diesen obligatorischen Fragen und reden Tacheles:
Was ist deine Lieblingsfarbe?
Nika08: Geschockt von der ersten Farbe, die mir da durch den Kopf geht, sage ich grau (?! o_O)
Gleich gehe ich los und suche die n√§chste Br√ºcke zum Springen.
VwieVeteran: Besser nicht bevor das Interview vorbei ist :(
Da nehm lieber noch ein Kippe ;)
Bist Dorf- oder Stadtkind?
Nika08: Hoodkind
Also Stadtkind, nur mehr Gangster
VwieVeteran: Wenn du √ºberall, wo du willst, f√ºr einen Tag hingehen k√∂nntest. Wohin w√ºrdest du gehen?
Nika08: Dahin, wo Eminem an diesem Tag ist
Stalkeralarm ^^
VwieVeteran: Falls Eminem zu dem Zeitpunkt auf einem Festival ist, welches du f√ºr ein Wochenende mit deinen Freunden besuchst. Welche drei Alben w√ºrdest du als auserkorene Zeltplatz-DJ-Queen mitnehmen?
Beachte bei der Wahl, dass du nicht unbedingt die anderen zufriedenstellen willst, sondern selber Spass haben sollst.
Nika08: Schnell mal meine meist gespielten Sachen aufm iPod checken...
Crackstreet Boys 3 (obwohl die Entscheidung zwischen 2 und 3 fast schon an Folter grenzt)
Genetikk - D.N.A. (ebenfalls widerwillig f√ºr nur einen Teil des Gesamtkunstwerks entschieden)
√ñhm..
Ahh und The Hits Chapter One von den Backstreet Boys.
Das wird ein Fest :D
Wobei meine Wahl wohl nicht auf BSB, sondern ein Eminem-Album gefallen w√§re, w√ºrde ich den nicht auf dem Festival besuchen :D
VwieVeteran: BSB und Gnkk nacheinander... Eine wahnwitzige Kombi
Was hast du denn schon so alles wahnwitziges auf einen Festival erlebt? Was war dein krassestes Festivalerlebnis? (falls halbwegs jugendfrei) Und bist du √ºberhaupt ein gro√üartiger Festivalgeher?
Nika08: Ich finde eher die Tatsache kribbitzig und strange, dass ich BSB auf einem Festival pumpe w√ºrde, auf dem Eminem performt. Zwar werden in seinen Songs ""I'm Back"" und ""The Way I Am"" nur N'Sync namentlich erw√§hnt, aber gemeint waren damit ja alle Boygroups.
√ñhm ich war vorletztes Jahr auf dem Spack!-Festival in Wirges und auf dem Trailerpark Open-Air in M√ºnster. Auf dem Spack! habe ich Alligatoah kurz kennenlernen d√ºrfen, das bleibt nat√ºrlich im Ged√§chtnis. Dieses Jahr war ich auch auf dem Trailerpark Open-Air, diesmal in meiner Cit√© K√∂ln. Zum Abschluss gab es ein Feuerwerk w√§hrend der Song ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"" von Elton John gespielt wurde und wirklich ALLE da versammelten Vollassis (Trailerpark-Fans halt) haben so laut sie konnten und mit all ihrer Liebe mitgesungen - da hatte ich schon G√§nsehaut am ganzen K√∂rper!
Also ich w√ºrde sagen, ich bin Festival- und KonzertgeherIN^^
Ich spiele seit dem diesj√§hrigen Trailerpark Open-Air auch mit dem Gedanken, Ende des Jahres nach Berlin zu fahren um mir die ""Trailerpark ab 18 Show"" mal zu geben - einfach weil ich's kann ;)
VwieVeteran: Wenn dir jemand (Achtung Matrixreferenz!) eine blaue und eine rote Kapsel anbietet, welche w√ºrdest du nehmen?
Nika08: Die rote und dann ab in den Kaninchenbau.
VwieVeteran: Du hattest erw√§hnt, dass du die Ehre hattest Alligatoah zu treffen (timepalace wird neidisch sein). Aber welchen Rapper / welche Rapcrew w√ºrdest du am liebsten mal treffen und mit ihr quatschen?
Nika08: Genetikk!
Durch mein Volontariat bei Hiphop.de habe ich den ein oder anderen ja schon getroffen oder auch interviewt, aber Genetikk kamen leider erst exakt in dem Monat an den Start, in dem mein Volontariat endete. Ich h√§tte mega viele Fragen zu den verschiedenen Sinnebenen, -bildern etc., wovon man auch beim 100sten Mal H√∂ren noch neue entdeckt. Ich f√§nde es auch echt interessant, mal zu erfahren was die Jungs zu meinen Textinterpretationen sagen. K√∂nnte ja sein, dass ich bisher nur Bullshit zu deren Lyrics verfasst und feucht fr√∂hlich auf Genius.com annotiert habe. Das w√ºsste ich gerne mal^^
Ach und mit Eminem nat√ºrlich! Aber wer w√ºrde nicht gerne mal mit Gott quatschen?!
Uuund
mit Lance Butters zu chillen stell ich mir ... naja ... chillig vor. Der regt sich immer so unterhaltsam √ºber alles auf.
Shame on me! Mir ist noch einer eingefallen, und zwar Marius M√ºller-Westernhagen, dessen Musik mich schon mein Leben lang begleitet. Zu vielen seiner Lyrics gibt es leider so gut wie keine Hintergrundinformationen, was mich echt wurmt!
VwieVeteran: Apropos Westernhagen!
Auf Genius bist du - wie bei bap - seine Nummer Eins
Ist diese Art von Musik dein zweites Steckpferd? Wie kommt es dazu? Was gef√§llt dir an dieser Musik so?
Nika08: Beide Acts habe ich durch meinen Vater kennengelernt. Der h√∂rt die schon seit ihren Anf√§ngen und zusammen mit mir seit dem ersten Tag, den ich auf der Welt bin. BAP hat sogar schon live gesehen, als die noch in irgendwelchen K√∂lner Garagen gespielt haben. BAP l√§sst mein k√∂lsches Herz nat√ºrlich auch h√∂her schlagen und sorgt ganz nebenbei auch daf√ºr, dass mein k√∂lsches Sprachgef√ºhl nicht einrostet. Was aber ein ganz gro√üer und wie ich finde auch wichtiger Unterschied zwischen BAP und vielen anderen K√∂lner Bands ist, ist das BAP Rockmusik macht und absolut nichts mit Karneval zu tun hat. Vom Stil kann man die fr√ºhen BAP-St√ºcken mit den Rolling Stones vergleichen. Nur, dass sie auf ihrer Muttersprache - K√∂lsch - singen.
Bei Marius M√ºller-Westernhagen war im Grunde nicht anders, au√üer dass der nicht in Garagen in K√∂ln aufgetreten ist. Ich erinnere mich noch mega gut an sein Konzert 1995 im M√ºngersdorfer Stadion. Meine Eltern, meine Schwester, ich und einige hundert weitere Fans haben sich mit Decken auf die gro√üe Wiese vor das Stadion gesetzt und die Musik gefeiert. Ich war damals 6 Jahre alt und konnte jeden Song voll mitsingen.
Wenn das mal keine mega gute Erkl√§rung f√ºr meine Liebe zu diesen K√ºnstler ist, dann will ich kein Genius sein ;p
VwieVeteran: Das ist mehr als geniusw√ºrdig!
Wenn du f√ºr den Rest deines Lebens nur noch mit einer Person reden darfst, wer w√ºrde es sein und weshalb?
Nika08: Alter... was f√ºr 'ne krasse Schei√üe du hier wissen willst! Wie soll man sich da f√ºr jemanden entscheiden?! o_O
Ich w√ºrde mich wohl f√ºr die Person entscheiden, der ich am ehesten zu Dank verpflichtet bin und das ist bei mein Vater (stellvertretend f√ºr die ganze Familie).
VwieVeteran: Sehr loyal!
Vorhin erw√§hntest du dein Volontariat bei HipHop.de. (Neid)
Welche Erfahrungen k√∂nntest du daraus machen und was kannst du davon f√ºr deine Arbeit auf Genius mitnehmen, warum ist der Rand vom K√§se schon wieder hart und warum k√∂nnen wir nicht auf B√§ren zur Arbeit reiten?:)
Nika08: Ja, so bin ich ;p
Erst durch die Arbeit in der Redaktion habe ich damals herausgefunden, in welche Richtung es bei mir beruflich gehen sollte, was ja schon mal 'ne richtig dufte Erkenntnis ist!
Durch den t√§glichen Redaktionsstruggle wurde mir (allen anderen Mitarbeiterin nat√ºrlich auch) von Anfang an viel Eigenverantwortung √ºbertragen, was in einem T√§tigkeitsfeld wie dem der Online-Redakteurin in dieser Branche einfach mal cool ist und zus√§tzlich eine super Arbeitsumgebung schafft, um selbstst√§ndiges Arbeiten zu √ºben, viele verschiedene Skills zu erlernen und sich auch pers√∂nlich weiterzuentwickeln zu k√∂nnen.
Ich w√ºrde sagen, dass vor allem der regelm√§√üige Umgang mit der deutschen Sprache beim Verfassen verschiedener Textsorten und der damals gewonnene Einblick in die Musikbranche bei meiner Arbeit auf Genius von Nutzen sind.
VwieVeteran: Das merkt man! Deine Annotationen sind meist von hoher sprachlicher Qualit√§t und wirken authentisch :)
Gerade deine Liste von Mythologie-Referenzen in Deutschraptracks fasziniert.
Hast du schon weitere Ideen f√ºr Projekte, mit denen du Genius bereichern m√∂chtest?
Nika08: Danke dir! Was f√ºr ein Tr√§umchen derart positives Feedback zu bekommen. Jetzt w√ºrd ich aber gerne erfahren, was genau du an dieser Liste faszinierend findest.
VwieVeteran: Deine Erl√§uterungen sind fundiert und stichhaltig und fasziniert bin ich zudem √ºber die vielen Referenzen, die du gefunden hast!
Ich h√§tte niemals gedacht, dass man da so viel rausholen kann!
Nika08: Was die meisten jetzt sicher schocken wird, ist dass ich Genetikk, Eminem, BAP und Westernhagen extrem abfeier'.
Dementsprechend bewegen sich meine Projektideen und andere Vors√§tze in deren Gefilden auf Genius.
Bei BAP und Westernhagen hat man an der Vervollst√§ndigung der Diskografien sicher bis ins hohe Rentenalter Freude.
Was Eminem auf Genius Deutschland angeht denke ich, dass sich einige Fans √ºber mehr deutsche √úbersetzungen und nat√ºrlich auch deutsche Annos sehr freuen w√ºrden (ich auf jeden Fall!). Also steht bei mir die Mission ""GermanShady"" aufer Liste.
Und zwar zusammen mit einem ganz eigenem Genetikk-Projekt, das aber noch so frisch ist, dass ich dazu jetzt lieber nicht viel sage bzw. dazu gibt es noch nicht wirklich viel zu sagen.
VwieVeteran: Oh da bin ich ja mal gespannt! Germanshady finde ich auch eine gute Idee, da man es sich als deutscher schon gerne einmal schwer tut bei m&ms Texten.
K√ºrzlich hattest du noch im Rahmen der deutschen Genius User Interviews eine weitere Idee und zwar ein Interviewvideo zusammen mit Sina. Wie stehst du aktuell dazu? Denkst du es gibt noch eine M√∂glichkeit, dass dies entstehen k√∂nnte?
Nika08: Diesen Vorschlag hatte mal ich in den Raum geworfen, weil bei Sina und mir die Gegebenheiten so sch√∂n passen, um mit geringem Aufwand ein Videointerview auf die Beine zu stellen. Wir wohnen recht nah beieinander, reden gerne und lieben uns.^^ Au√üerdem hatte ich scheinbar einen mutigen Tag, da ich eigentlich sehr Kamerascheu bin und mich mit diesem Interview selbst ein bisschen Schocktherapieren wollte. Da der Vorschlag von der doofen Sina aber direkt zerschmettert wurde, werden wir wohl beim Alt¬≠be¬≠w√§hrten bleiben - dem geschriebenen Wort.
VwieVeteran: Was f√ºr 1 doofe Sina ^^
Naja vielleicht ergibt sich da ja noch was, die Idee ist n√§mlich ziemlich cool.
Nichtsdestotrotz bedanke ich mich f√ºr deine interessanten und offenen Antworten.
Hiermit w√ºrde ich dieses Deutsche Genius Users Interview abschlie√üen. Die Schlussworte geh√∂ren dir! Falls ich vergessen haben sollte etwas anzusprechen, kannst du das hier auch noch tun. :D
Nika08: Ich f√§nde es auch echt cool zur Abwechslung mal nicht zu lesen, sondern nur zu gucken und zu h√∂ren. Ich bedanke mich f√ºr dein Interesse an dem ganzen Zeug, dass ich dir hier erz√§hlt habe!
Bevor meine Schlussworte kommen, f√ºr die ich seit 2004 auf eine passende Gelegenheit gewartet habe, will ich unbedingt noch loswerden, dass ihr alle hier die tollsten seid! Ich hab' euch absolut nicht kommen sehen, als ich anfing aktiv auf Genius mitzuarbeiten. Umso mehr feier' ich euch jetzt nat√ºrlich und finde es toll dazuzugeh√∂ren. Bleibt wir ihr seid, denn ihr seid Genius!
Und noch ein Wort an meine Fans zum Schluss: Ihr seid mir alle egal, ich schreib' nur weil ich muss!"

And close your eyes and hit the switch
We're going to a place where everybody kick it, kick it, kick it
Yea that's the ticket

Ain't no punk ass niggas set trippin'
Everybody got a stack and it ain't no crack

If ya can't take the heat get ya ass out the kitchen

Slide, slide slippity slide
I'm hittin switches on the block in a 65
Come along and ride on fantastic voyage
Slide, slide hoo ride, ain't no valley low enough or mountain high

I'm tryin to find a place where I can live my life and
Maybe eat some steak with my beans and rice
A place where my kids can play outside without livin in fear of a drive by
And even if I get away from them drive by killaz
I still gotta worry about those snitch ass niggas
I keep on searchin' and I keep on lookin'
But niggas are the same from Watts to Brooklyn
I try to keep my faith in my people
But sometimes my people be actin' like they evil
You don't understand about runnin' with a gang
Cause you don't gang bang
And you don't have to stand on the corner and slang
Cause you got your own thang
You can't help me if you can't help yourself
You better make a left

Slide, slide slippity slide
I do what I do just to survive
(Come along and ride on a Fantastic Voyage)
Slide slide hoo ride, that's why I pack my 45

Life is a bitch and then you die
Still trying to get a piece of that apple pie
Every game ain't the same cause the game still remain
Don't it seem kinda strange ain't a damn thing changed
If you don't work then you don't eat
And only down ass niggas can ride with me
Hip hop hop your 45 quickly down the block
Stay sucker free and keep the busters of your jock
You gotta have heart son if you wanna go
Watch this sweet chariot, swing low
Ain't nobody crying ain't nobody dyin'
Ain't nobody worryin' everybody's tryin'
Nothing from nothin' leaves nothin'
If you wanna have somethin' you better stop frontin'
What you gonna do when the 5 rolls by?
You better be ready so you can ride

Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage

From the battles that rage in my head
You make sense of madness
When my sanity hangs by a thread
I lose my way but still you seem to understand

Sometimes I just hold you
Too caught up in me to see
I'm holding a fortune
That heaven has given to me
I'll try to show you each and every way I can
Now and forever, I will be your man
Now I can rest my worries and always be sure
That I won't be alone anymore
If I'd only known you were there all the time
All this time
Until the day the ocean doesn't touch the sand
Now and forever, I will be your man

This ain't no disco
It ain't no country club either
This is LA!

""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die,""
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing
He says his name is William, but I'm sure
He's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me, and I wonder if
He's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world are washing their cars
On their lunch break, hosing and scrubbing
As best they can in skirts in suits
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me, cause

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Letting each one burn down to his thick fingers
Before blowing and cursing them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud
As they spin on the floor
And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads, but

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty
Cars
The sun and the moon but

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling the party's just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won't tell you that you're the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard"

And I would do anything for love
But I won't do that,
No I won't do that
Anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No I won't do that

And some days it don't come easy
And some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all
And these are the days that never end
And some nights you're breathing fire
And some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothing I've ever
Seen before, or will again

And maybe I'm crazy
Oh it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me
No one else can save me now but you
As long as the planets are turning
As long as the stars are burning
As long as your dreams are coming true-
You better believe it!

That I would do anything for love!
And I'll be there till the final act
And I would do anything for love!
And I'll take the vow and seal a pact
But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way
Tonight
And I would do anything for love!
Oh I would do anything for love!
Oh I would do anything for love!
But I won't do that!
No I won't do that!

And some days I pray for Soul
Some days I just pray to the God
Of Sex and Drums and Rock 'N' Roll
And some nights I lose the feeling
And some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all
When I watch you dance and the thunder rolls

And maybe I'm lonely
That's all I'm qualified to be
There's just one and only
One and only promise I can keep
As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true
You better believe it!

That I would do anything for love!
And you know it's true and thats a fact
I would do anything for love!
And there'll never be no turning back
But I'll never do it better than I do it with you
So long
So long

Oh I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No I won't do that

Will you raise me up?
Will you help me down?
Will you help get me right out of this Godforsaken town?
Will you make it all a little less cold?

I can do that!
I can do that!

Will you hold me sacred
Will you hold me tight
Will you colorize my life
I'm so sick of black and white!
Can you make it all a little less old

I can do that!
Oh, Oh, I can do that!

Will you make me some magic with your own two hands?
Can you build an emerald city with these grains of sand?
Can you give me something I can take home?

I can do that
I can do that

Will you cater to every fantasy I've got?
Will you hose me down with holy water - If I get too hot?
Will you take me to places I'll never know?

I can do that!
Oh no, no, I can do that!

After a while you'll forget everything
Just a brief interlude, and a mid-summer night's fling
Then you'll see that it's time to move on

I won't do that
I won't do that

I know the territory - I've been around
It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
Sooner or later you'll be screwing around

I won't do that!
No, I won't do that!

Anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love!
I would do anything for love!
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that"

Keep your memory alive

A lifetime of memories
Going down the drain
I'd like to keep steppin'

My God, my God
Could you pass on a message for me?
Tell him put down those dice for a second, Lord
Listen to his homie
Could you tell him
I'll never let go of his memory?
So his son will know
He don't have to cry no more
Cause God's got his back, I said God's got his back
A lifetime of memories
Going down the drain
I'd like to keep steppin'
But I can't get past the pain

Take a drink, and I
Stop to think, and I

A recording for Blue Note Records
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, what's that)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, funky funky)
How 'bout a big hand now (wa-wait a minute)
Groovy groovy jazzy funky pounce bounce dance
As we dip in the melodic sea
Rhythm keeps flowin', drip's the MC
Sweet sugar pop sugar pop rocks
Pop you don't stop til the sweet beat drops
I show and prove as I stick and move
Every poem's recited on top of the groove
Smooth, my, floatin' like a butterfly
Notes that I float, sung like a lullaby
Brace yourself as the beat hits ya, dip trip, flip fantasia
Feel the beat drop, jazz and hip-hop
Drippin' in your dome makes you zone and bop
Funk and fusion a fly illusion
Keeps ya coastin' on the rhythm ya cruisin'
Up down, round and round, rhymes profound
But nevertheless you've got to get down
Fantasy freak through the beat so unique
You move your feet and sweat from the heat
Back to the fact I'm the mack and I know that
The way I kick the rhyme some will call me a poet
Poem steady flowin', growin' showin' sights and sounds
Caught in the groove in the tale I found
Many tripped the tour upon the rhymes they saw
To an infinite height, to the realm of the hardcore
Here we go, off I take ya, dip trip, flip fantasia
Jump to the jam, boogie woogie jam slam
Bust the dialect I'm the man in command
Come flow with the sounds of the mighty mic master
Rhymin' on the mic I'll bring the suckers to disaster
Boukou ducks but I still rock Nike
With the razzle dazzle, star I might be
Scribble drabble scrabble on the microphone I babble
As I fix the funky words into a puzzle
Yes yes yes, on and on as I flex
Get with the flow, verbs manifest
Feel the vibe from here to Asia, dip trip, flip fantasia
Ow, you don't stop
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

Is that really a question?
Do you really have that written down in your notepad?
You should be ashamed of yourself
You smell me girl
I smell like money
See, thats what they don't understand (Tell 'em a god damn thang)
To me it was always get money or die
I come up under Birdman, the Number One Stunna
You know what I mean I'm Stunna Jr. thats all I know thats all I ever knew
Get money or get nothing you know what I'm saying
And I feel that way
Foreal

So hard I go I keep pushing
The game so crazy I'm in it like deep pussy
I got chip from trying to get the whole cookie
Used to make a thousand dollars everytime I played hookie
Dwayne Carter absent keep looking
I'm present on the block
I'm a legend on the block
Ice so bright like heaven on the watch
Yea nigga I done dropped one eleven on the watch
So watch and see what I do
Breeze by you so fast got you sneezing hachoo
They got the shivers 'mayne I got the fever
I got to bring the hood back after Katrina
Weezy F Baby, now the 'F' is for FEMA
Sick nigga bitch I spit that Leukemia
Yea no cure no help
So me so good so hard so felt
Feel me

And that's just my point right there
That's what I'm always trying to stress know what I'm saying
If you don't understand me if you don't feel me then you ain't real
In my eyes, and that's all that count to me you know

So, is your music considered the voice of urban America or America period?

I mean, I would say the voice of the hood cause thats who I speak for
And myself, you know what I mean, my family thats who I represent
My homies, my girl, my life you know

C'mon, bang this shit nigga pump my shit
You gotta bang that wimp and go and dump that bitch
You gotta claim that strip and go and flood that bitch
You gotta aim that shit and straight bust that shit
Like motherfuck them niggas what they wan-do I'm ready
Tevin Campbell, no homo, black Rambo
Fucking with the boy baby that's a gamble
If he won in Vegas leave him on the crap table
I'm willing and I'm able to come run up in your stable
Like nobody make a sound where the paper where the paper
Gotta get it gotta have it
Once I got it I'mma spend it
Then its back to doing any damn thing just to get it
The re-ups be like birthday parties
No room to park the cars in the garages
So outside the cribs all you see is arayis
If I ain't say it right fuck it I ain't foreign
Feel me

And see thats where everybody get me wrong at, you know what I mean?
I got that heat rock, foreal

Why do you think other rappers lack the impact of your music?

Thats because they ain't got that heat rock like me you know what I mean
They ain't spitting like me
They spitting, but, know what I mean, they ain't got colds
I got the flu over here man, foreal
I need relief, y'all help me
I know y'all sick of me, cause I'm tired of y'all foreal

And based on the bank, I'm doing much better than alot of these niggas
I'm tired of these niggas

Dog food skulls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with the loser in the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the love-seat
Someone came in saying I‚Äôm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don‚Äôt believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps and burning down the trailer park
Yo, cut it

The forces of evil in a bozo nightmare
Ban all the music with the phony gas chamber
Cause one‚Äôs got a weasel and the other‚Äôs got a flag
One‚Äôs on the pole, shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose-job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey-neck and it's hanging from a pigeon wing
You can't get right if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beat for the body for the hate
And my time is a piece of wax falling on a termite
Who‚Äôs choking on the splinters

Did you love me only in my head?

The freaks would ya move ya booties
The getto jam is about to slam
With some notes from the diggady D-E
As I key what's really goin on
Would ya reminisce with me-e

Saturday mornin' just gettin up
With a hangover smellin' like I fucked
I really can't remember cause I'm still kinda faded
So I close my eyes and thank God that I made it
Now I'm gettin flashbacks of some O.J
With a green glass, says Tanqueray
Took it to the head, gulped it down with the quickness
Now I need a bitch so I can handle my business
What do you know, a freak's in my reach
Threw her on the flo', stuck it in her deep
She's screamin and she's screamin and she's screamin, gettin hoarse
But then I busted a nut, and that was that
So kick the chorus


My homies are down, chillin' in the hood
But them hood bitches, well they ain't no good
To another man well she might be some good cat
But homies in the hood label her as a hood rat
She's scandalous
So those with game can fuck
And ooh, she'll clown your ass real fast, if you're quick to nut
And when you're in that thi-ing
She'll make a nigga si-ng
Duh-du-dway, duh-dum-dway, duh-dum-dway
But you don't hear me doe
Ain't nuthin wrong with being a Trojan man, when ya ridin
So let's kick the chorus please if ya like it


My homie's clownin' in his dope, yellow chevy
Too O.D.'ed to be dropped
Kenwood's kickin that funk in the trunk
Clean with the rag on top, yeah
Rollin down the 'Shaw, guess what we saw, some bitches
The finest one is on my nuts, she's blowing kisses
So I approached the freak of the week
And I played it like a game of blackjack
And for all that ass that she toted around
Well I offered a backpack
And since I'm a mack
Well you know how the story goes
So all ya hoes and their bros here we go"

If you don't hear what I say
What I need from you is understanding
So simple as 1-2-3
Understanding is what we need

You don't really know me
You just wanna do what you wanna do
That's not the way it should be
No, you should listen to me boy
I try so very hard to make you understand
But the choices you make, baby they're all demands

I try so very hard to keep our love alive
But you don't wanna meet me half way
Then the understanding dies
There's no way that we can work it out
If we don't pull together
I don't mean to be demanding
But I want some understanding
I want to be with you


I listen to you baby
And I know the things you're going through
I try to understand
That's why I'm still with you, baby
See everyday we're living
Is one thing that will always be unsure
That's why I need you baby, pleading baby
Please let our love endure"

And a little girl named Corin

Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares if don't nobody else care
And I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
‚ÄòCause, sister, you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em
You know what makes me unhappy?
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women ‚Äî do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up

Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter

Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with a local crew and had a smoke or two
And I realize Mama really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay the rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin' for the pen
I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up
You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
They got money for wars but can't feed the poor
Say there ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, ‚Äòcause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up

Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter

And uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
‚ÄòCause I think we can make it; in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more
‚ÄòCause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless
While tears is rollin' down your cheeks
You steady hopin' things don't fall down this week
‚ÄòCause if it did, you couldn't take it
And don't blame me ‚Äî I was given this world, I didn't make it
And now my son's gettin' older and older
And cold from havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up
But please, you got to keep ya head up"

'Cause you talk to me like lovers do
I feel joy, I feel pain 'cause it's still the same
When the night is gone, I'll be alone

Another night, another dream, but always you
It's like a vision of love that seems to be true
Another night, another dream, but always you
In the night, I dream of love so true

I talk talk, I talk to you
In the night, in your dream, of love so true
I talk talk, I talk to you, in the night, in your dream, of love so true

In the night, in my dreams I'm in love with you
'Cause you talk to me like lovers do
I feel joy, I feel pain, 'cause it's still the same
When the night is gone, I'll be alone

Another night, another dream, but always you
It's like a vision of love that seems to be true
Another night, another dream, but always you
In the night, I dream of love so true"

We'd be listening to the radio so loud and so strong
Every golden nugget coming like a gift of the gods
Someone must have blessed us when he gave us those songs
I treasure your love
I never want to lose it
You've been through the fires of hell
And I know you've got the ashes to prove it
I treasure your love
I want to show you how to use it
You've been through a lot of pain in the dirt
And I know you've got the scars to prove it
Remember everything that I told you
And I'm telling you again that it's true
When you're alone and afraid
And you're completely amazed
To find there's nothing anybody can do
Keep on believing
And you'll discover baby
There's always something magic
There's always something new
And when you really, really need it the most
That's when rock and roll dreams come through
The beat is yours forever
The beat is always true
And when you really need it the most
That's when rock and roll dreams come through for you
Once upon a time was a backbeat
Once upon a time all the chords came to life
And the angels had guitars even before they had wings
If you hold onto a chorus you can get through the night
I treasure your love
I never want to lose it
And you've been through the fires of hell
And I know you've got the ashes to prove it
I treasure you love
I want to show you how to use it

And let the drummer tell your heart what to do
Keep on believing
And you'll discover baby
There's always something magic
There's always something new
And when you really, really need it the most
That's when rock and roll dreams come through
The beat is yours forever
The beat is always true
And when you really, really need it the most
That's when rock and roll dreams come through for you
(The beat is yours forever
That's when rock and roll dreams come through)
(The beat is yours forever
That's when rock and roll dreams come through)
(The beat is yours forever
That's when rock and roll dreams come through)
(The beat is yours forever
That's when rock and roll dreams come through)

2972,72,Amazing,Aerosmith,1994,amazing,aerosmith, NA ,1.0,1,"I kept the right ones out
And let the wrong ones in
Had an angel of mercy to see me through all my sins
There were times in my life
When I was goin' insane
Tryin' to walk through the pain
When I lost my grip, and I hit the floor
Yeah, I thought I could leave but couldn't get out the door
I was so sick and tired of livin' a lie
I was wishin that I would die

It's amazing
With the blink of an eye you, finally see the light
It's amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
It's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight

That one last shot's a permanent vacation
And how high can you fly with broken wings?
Life's a journey, not a destination
And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings

You have to learn to crawl
Before you learn to walk
But I just couldn't listen to all that righteous talk, oh yeah
I was out on the street
Just tryin' to survive
Scratchin' to stay alive

It's amazing
With the blink of an eye you, finally see the light
It's amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
It's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight
Desperate hearts, desperate hearts....


""So from all of us at Aerosmith to all of you out there, wherever you are, remember: the light at the end of the tunnel may be you. Good night."""

Had a good lookin' mama who never was around
But she grew up tall and she grew up right
With them Indiana boys on them Indiana nights
Well, she moved down here at the age of eighteen
She blew the boys away, was more than they'd seen
I was introduced and we both started groovin'
She said, ""I dig you baby, but I got to keep movin' on
Keep movin' on""

Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again

Well, I don't know, but I've been told
You never slow down, you never grow old
I'm tired of screwin' up, tired of going down
Tired of myself, tired of this town

Oh, my, my, oh, hell yes
Honey, put on that party dress
Buy me a drink, sing me a song
Take me as I come 'cause I can't stay long

Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again

There's pigeons down on Market Square
She's standin' in her underwear
Lookin' down from a hotel room
The nightfall will be comin' soon

Oh, my, my, oh, hell yes
You got to put on that party dress
It was too cold to cry when I woke up alone
I hit my last number and walked to the road

Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again"

You will always be
Beautiful in my eyes
And the passing years will show
That you will always grow

We can laugh about
How time really flies

""Yeah I've seen guys with their heads cut off, blown up, burnt, shot, stabbed, poisoned, hanged, run over by trains, cars blown off, I mean fucking you name it, I've seen it.""
We assumed you wanted our official apologies, along with the body

Keep it wicked like six witches, five skulls in one kettle
Let it boil till it scorch and burn the instrumental
Fever kill, we the hottest, your temperature has been arised
As we take these microphones and then blacken up both your eyes

I got an axe in my hand, bitch, when I don't chatter
From the talking in my head telling me to make the blood splatter
Climbing up a ladder and I hang em on a hook
Diabolical on every life I took
Travel underground in the fire like hellspawn
And possess a motherfucker to murder ya on ya lawn
Pick up a cellphone tell the devil you coming home
But I keep getting disconnected cause my minds on roam
Everybody dies when your fucking with psychos
All alone at midnight, might slice your throat

Sick and deranged words are irrelevant
Knife cuts clean through the skin to the skeleton
Consistent like residual whores
Like them wicked wannabe's with flyers and bloody corpse
We stay eternal vampiric when you hear it
As it seeping through the speakers, trying to grab hold of your spirit

Split tongue, sick one, I'll spit some
Moonlight with shadows of lost souls and victims
Parish in the heart of my darkness
I'm heartless and I don't have a concious to start with
I'm marked with an X as a symbol of greatness
To hate this will only explain all of your fakeness
Watch me blaze this place with the strike of a match
And disappear in the form of a bat

The wicked's keep it vertigo
Control and the horizontal and vertical
On the path of the pinnacle of my sinister ritiual
I'm dangerous, repetitious like D√©j√† Vu
Meaning I've been here before and already know what I'mma do
Falling fast, the furious wins
Seeing faces on the wall laced with hideous grins
Eyes blinking at me, lips moving, counting the sins
A million arms at the bottom are waving me all in
THAT'S WICKED"

Just like Uniblab, robotic kicking flab
My flavor bidder badder chitter-chatter
Madder than the Mad Hatter
I bet you my shit come out phatter
I got the data to turn your body into anti-matter
And just like a piece of Sizzlean
You'll fit inside my stomach with the eggs and grits between
The king is what I mean, I mean
My man get a cup and put some change inside your hand
Now, hold up, let's make this official
Everybody let's agree that MC's need a tissue
The funk's my only issue
I bet your mama miss you
And I bet the Mack take off, like an MX missile
No more of your whinin' on the charts climbin'
As I make the funk kicking out more harder than a diamond
And if you didn't know who's rhymin'
I guess I'm gonna say ""Craig Mack"" with perfect timin'
You won't be around next year
My rap's too severe, kickin' mad flava in ya ear

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

Craig Mack, one thousand degrees
You'll be on your knees, and you'll be burning, begging please
Brother, freeze! This man's undisputed
In deep-rooted funk smoke that leaves your brains booted
This bad MC with stamina like Bruce Jenner
The winner, tasting MC's for dinner
You're crazy like that glue, to think that you could outdo my one-two that's sick like the flu
Boy, I flip, boy, all the time
‚ÄòCause, boy, the rhyme you kickin' ain't worth a dime
Seems like there's no competition in this rap world expedition
You come around, I'll knock you out position
No flav could ever dig a grave, for the Mack
The power pack in black, making cement crack
And here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

Ha! The Mack's dope with more hope than your Pope
But for MC's more knots than rope
I'd like to break it down, down-breaking forsaken
Lords of MC's shakin' with this track that my man's makin'
MC's will run like a bomb threat
I bet, or better yet, make you sweat
Getting hotter than the sun get
Craig Mack is the flav that rocks from here to Tibet
I break all rules with my action
That the Mack sends to MC's, stop relaxin'
This brand new Sherrif that's in town
Getting down, leaving bodies buried in the ground
I set up rhymes for a decoy
Now I'm a Bad Boy, watch the MC's I destroy, and‚Ä¶

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear

Instinct leads me to another flow
Every time I hear a brother call a girl a bitch or a ho
Tryna make a sister feel low
You know all of that gots to go
Now everybody knows there's exceptions to this rule
Now don't be gettin' mad, when we playin', it's cool
But don't you be calling me out my name
I bring wrath to those who disrespect me like a dame
That's why I'm talkin', one day I was walkin' down the block
I had my cutoff shorts on right cause it was crazy hot
I walked past these dudes when they passed me
One of 'em felt my booty, he was nasty
I turned around red, somebody was catchin' the wrath
Then the little one said, ""Ha ha, yeah me, bitch,"" and laughed
Since he was with his boys, he tried to break fly
Huh, I punched him dead in his eye
And said, ""Who you callin' a bitch?"" Yeah !

I hit the bottom, there ain't nowhere else to go but up
Bad days at work give you an attitude and you erupt
And take it out on me but that's about enough
You put your hands on me again I'll put your ass in handcuffs
I guess I fell so deep in love I grew dependency
I was too blind to see just how it was affectin' me
All that I knew was you was all the man I had
And I was scared to let you go
Even though you treated me bad
But I don‚Äôt want to see my kids see me gettin' beat down by daddy smackin' mommy all around
You say I'm nothin' without ya but I'm nothing' with ya
A man don't really love you if he hits ya
This is my notice to the door, I'm not takin' it no more
I'm not your personal whore, that's not what I'm here for
And nothing good gon' come to ya til you do right by me

What's goin' on in your mind is what I ask ya
But like Yo-Yo, you don't hear me though
You wear a rag around your head
And you call yourself a ""gangsta bitch""
Now that you saw Apache's video
I saw you wildin', actin' like a fool
I peeped you out the window jumping girls after school
But where did all of this come from?
A minute ago, you was a nerd and nobody ever heard of ya
Now you a wannabe... hard
You barely know your ABC's, please
There's plenty of people out there with triggers ready to pull it
Why you tryna jump in front of the bullet (Young lady) ?
Uh, and real bad girls are the silent type
Ain't none of this worth gettin' your face sliced
Cause that's what happened to your homegirl, right?
(Barking with no bite!)
She got to wear that for life
(Who you callin' a bitch? Uh !)

U.N.I.T.Y., U.N.I.T.Y. that's a unity (Here we go, you gotta let him know)

Careless needle
Harsh words spoken
And lives are broken
Forceful aging
Help me, I'm fading
Heaven's waiting
It's time to move on

Crossing that bridge
With lessons I've learned
Playing with fire
And not getting burned
I may not know what you're going through
But time is the space between me and you
Life carries on
It goes on

Just say, ""Die,"" and that would be pessimistic
In your mind, we can walk across water
Please don't cry, it's just a prayer for the dying
I just don't know what's got into me

Crossing that bridge
With lessons I've learned
Playing with fire
And not getting burned
I may not know what you're going through
But time is the space between me and you
Life carries on
It goes on

There is a light through that window
Hold on say yes, while people say no
Life carries on
It goes on

And I guess there's nothing more to say
Love can make you blind, make you act so strange
But I'm here and here I'll stay
So everyday I cry
Yes everyday I fall
Do you ever wonder why, why I love everything about you

But everyday I say I'll try to make my heart be still
Until then every way there is to cry, ourselves to sleep we will

It picked me up, knocked me off my feet
I've got no way to explain
Still i love you, love you, love you but this fire inside
Will never see the light of day
So everyday goes by
And everyday i fall
It makes me wonder why
My life's worth nothing without you

But everyday i say i'll try to make my heart be still
Until then every way there is to cry, ourselves to sleep we will

You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no
You'll never know just how close we were
You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no
You'll never know
No you'll never see

The book closes and we try to forget
But i know that things won't change
How we feel, how life goes on
And that seems so strange
And so the light fades away
Try, try, try as i may
I can't stop thinking about you
It seems my life's worth nothing without you

But everyday I say I'll try to make my heart be still
Until then every way there is to cry, ourselves to sleep we will

Everyday, everyday you know i try so hard
Everyday, everyday it gets a little harder

Everyday, everyday you know i try so hard
Everyday, everyday it gets a little harder

When he was eight years old
A little girl came through the front gate
Holdin' a fishin' pole
His dad looked down and smiled
Said, ""We can't leave her behind
Son, I know you don't want her to go
But someday you'll change your mind""

And Johnny said:

Take Jimmy Johnson, take Tommy Thompson
Take my best friend, Bo
Take anybody that you want as
Long as she don't go
Take any boy in the world
Daddy, please, don't take the girl

Same old boy, same sweet girl
Ten years down the road
He held her tight and kissed her lips in
Front of the picture show
Stranger came and pulled a gun
Grabbed her by the arm
Said, ""If you do what I tell you to, there
Won't be any harm""

And Johnny said:

Take my money, take my wallet
Take my credit cards
Here's the watch that my grandpa gave me
Here's the key to my car
Mister, give it a whirl
But, please, don't take the girl

Same old boy, same sweet girl
Five years down the road
There's gonna be a little one and she
Says, ""It's time to go""
Doctor says, ""The baby's fine
But you'll have to leave
'Cause his momma's fadin' fast"" and
Johnny hit his knees

And then he prayed:

Take the very breath you gave me
Take the heart from my chest
I'll gladly take her place if you'll let me
Make this my last request
Take me out of this world
God, please, don't take the girl

But you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up
It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see I've always been a fighter
But without you I give up
Now I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore
But baby, that's just me

And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
Till the heavens burst and
The words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always

Now your pictures that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
To touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man
When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I'll wish I was him cause those words are mine
To say to you till the end of time

Yeah, I will love you baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always

If you told me to cry for you
I could
If you told me to die for you
I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you
Well, there ain't no luck
In these loaded dice
But baby if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams
And our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines

And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
Till the heavens burst and
The words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always"

My mind's a burnin' hell
I got razors a-rippin' and tearin' and strippin'
My heart apart as well
Tonight you told me
That you ache for something new
And some other woman is looking like somethin'
That might be good for you

Go on, and hold her 'til the screaming is gone
Go on, believe her when she tells you
Nothing's wrong
But I'm the only one
Who'll walk across the fire for you
I'm the only one
Who'll drown in my desire for you
It's only fear that makes you run
The demons that you're hiding from
When all your promises are gone
I'm the only one

Please baby can't you see
I'm trying to explain
I've been here before and I'm locking the door
And I'm not going back again
Her eyes and arms and skin won't make
It go away
You'll wake up tomorrow and wrestle the sorrow
That holds you down today

Go on, and hold her 'til the screaming is gone
Go on, believe her when she tells you
Nothing's wrong
But I'm the only one
Who'll walk across the fire for you
And I'm the only one

But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

I remember (back in the days)
When I just a little niggarole
I looked up to my bigger bro
Begged if I could kick it so
When he went out with girls I could go tagging along
Nagging if she had a sis maybe could mack a baby hoodrat
Y'all remember way back then, when it was 1985
All the way live, I think I was about ten
One of those happy little niggas singing the blues
That be always trying to bag with the shag and karate shoes
Sayin ""Yo momma black; his momma this, his momma that""
Then he get mad and wanna scrap
We stay mad about, ten minutes then it's like back on the bike
To play hide and go get it with the younger hoes by the bungalows
Then switch to playing ding dong ditch, when that gets
Old and too cold to hack it, threw on a bomber jacket
You could tell the ballers cuz they bell wearing Gazelles
And if they really had money raised be sporting BK's
And, all the girls had they turkish link
If it broke then they made earrings to it, like they meant to do it
But, sometimes, I still sit and reminisce
Then, think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

And everybody say (I remember way back when)
And everybody say (I remember way back when)
And everybody say (I remember way back when)
What? (back in the day) When? (back in the day)

I'm still back in the days, but now the year is '87
'88 that's when my crew and I were in junior high
In 7th grade, I hated school (wish it'd blown up)
No doubt I couldn't wait to get out (and be a grownup)
But let me finish this reminiscing and telling
'Bout when girls was belling tight corduroys like for the boys
Basket weaves, Nike Cortez, and footsie socks
And eating pickles, with tootsie pops
And it don't stop, I'm glad cause when J.J. Fad hit
Supersonic it was kinda like a sport to wear biker shorts
Or to wear jeans and it seemed like the masses
Of hoochies had Poison airbrushed on they asses
Dudes had on Nike suits, and the Pumas with
The fat laces cause it was either that or K-Swiss
I miss those days and so I pout like a grown jerk
Wishing all I had to do now, was finish homework
It's true, you don't realize really what you got til it's gone
And I'm not, gonna sing another sad song, but
Sometimes I do sit and reminisce then
Think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

And everybody say (I remember way back when)
And everybody say (I remember way back when)
And everybody say (I remember way back when)
What? (back in the day) When? (back in the day)

Well, it's the niggarole, I figure that now I'm all grown up
Because I'm eighteen years old, and guess you could say I'm holding
Down a steady job and crew steady mobbing
You steady bobbing your head and I'm paid, so I got it made
But, didn't always have clout, used to live in South Central L.A
That's where I stayed and figured a way out
I gave it all I had so for what it's worth
I went from rags to riches which is a drag but now I'm first
So Ahmad and The Jones' is on our way up
Yup, we said that we was gonna make it since a kid
And we finally did, but
Sometimes I still sit and reminisce then
Think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

Sitting here waiting for your voice on the phone
Fever turns to cold cold sweat
Thinking about things we ain't done yet
Tell me now

Do you just light up at the mention of my name

Don't worry baby
Ain't nothin' new
That's just love sneakin' up on you
If your whole world is shakin'
And you feel like I do
That's just love sneakin' up on you
Nowhere on earth for your heart to hide
Once love comes sneaking up on your blind side
And you might as well try and stop the rain
Or stand in the track of a runaway train

And who could blame us
The word was we were just beside ourselves
And everybody said it wouldn't last
And now they wonder
Why we didn't last
We fell in love
It seemed so righteous
Couldn't compare our love to no one else
And everybody thought we could not win
It's no wonder
Love came to an end

And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers
From people we don't know
And our feelings, yeah
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion
From people who don't know
Who don't know...

We fell apart
The bond was broken
Should've kept our thoughts between ourselves
And though they say they cared
They didn't help
Makes me wonder
Should we blame ourselves?
So here we are
Broken hearted
What in the world have we done to ourselves?
When everybody says to let it end, baby
Well, it makes me wonder
We can't let them win

And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers
From people we don't know
And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion
From people who don't know

If we'd only just try, we could make it by
And maybe in time we could make it right
If we only had done what we shoulda done
We'd both be here still making love
I wanna know that, that we can go back
Back to the times when the lovin' was all that
When no one could come between our love

And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers
From people we don't know
And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion
From people who don't know
And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers
From people we don't know
And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion
From people who don't know"

As the buffalo bitch go round the outside
Put a glide in your stride and a dip in your hip
Got Daytons on the mothership
